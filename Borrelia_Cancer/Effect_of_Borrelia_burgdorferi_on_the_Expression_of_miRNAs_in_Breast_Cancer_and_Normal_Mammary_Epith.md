## Content

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women worldwide. Recent studies have demonstrated that inflammation due to infections with microorganisms could play a role in breast cancer development. One of the known human pathogens,Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, has been shown to be present in various types of breast cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. We reported thatB. burgdorferican invade breast cancer cells and affect their tumorigenic phenotype. To better understand the genome-wide genetic changes caused byB. burgdorferi, we evaluated the microRNA (miRNA or miR) expression profiles of two triple-negative breast cancer cell lines and one non-tumorigenic mammary cell line before and afterB. burgdorferiinfection. Using a cancer-specific miRNA panel, four miRNAs (miR-206, 214-3p, 16-5p, and 20b-5p) were identified as potential markers for Borrelia-induced changes, and the results were confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription (qRT-PCR). Among those miRNAs, miR-206 and 214 were the most significantly upregulated miRNAs. The cellular impact of miR-206 and 214 was evaluated using DIANA software to identify related molecular pathways and genes. Analyses showed that the cell cycle, checkpoints, DNA damage-repair, proto-oncogenes, and cancer-related signaling pathways are mostly affected byB. burgdorferiinfection. Based on this information, we have identified potential miRNAs which could be further evaluated as biomarkers for tumorigenesis caused by pathogens in breast cancer cells.
