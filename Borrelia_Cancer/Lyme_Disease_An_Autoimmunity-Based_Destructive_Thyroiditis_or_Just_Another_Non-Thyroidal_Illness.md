### Abstract

There is considerable evidence that some Borrelial (Lyme spirochetal) proteins share significant antigenic properties with several thyroid-related proteins (e.g. TSH receptor, thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase) and can induce thyroid autoimmunity, sometimes associated with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and perhaps also a “destructive thyroiditis” such as “silent” thyroiditis or “Hashitoxicosis.” As an acute illness, Lyme disease may also constitute a “non-thyroidal illness” capable of perturbing thyroid function tests without causing thyroid dysfunction. We report a 22-year old woman admitted with an acute paranoid schizophrenia, thyroid function tests consistent with autoimmunity, transient thyrotoxicosis (tachycardia, lid-lag, brisk DTR’s) and a greatly reduced radioiodine uptake. The thyroid was not palpably enlarged, nodular or tender. On screening assay, reactivity was demonstrated to 4 of 13 Borrelial proteins. Anti-Lyme IgM but not IgG, antibodies, were positive. This was consistent with recent Lyme disease infection. Serum TSH (NL: 0.358-3.74 mcU/ml), Free T4 (NL: 0.76-1.46 ng/dl), and Free T3 (NL: 2.18-3.98 pg/ml) were, respectively: Day1: 0.087 mcU/ml (suppressed), 1.52 ng/dl (slightly elevated), 2.07 pg/ml (slightly reduced); Day2: 0.148 (suppressed), 1.18 (normal), no FT3; Day4: 0.827 (normal), no FT4 or FT3; Day5: 1.66 (normal), 0.89 (normal), 1.77 (low). Anti-Tg and Anti-Peroxidase antibodies were both moderately elevated. Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulins were not elevated. The radioactive iodine uptake on Day4 was 2.8% (NL: 15-30% at 24 hr). Thyroid ultrasonogram was normal. An attractive explanation is that Lyme disease triggered a “destructive thyroiditis,” perhaps but not necessarily mediated by thyroid autoimmunity. This would account for the brief interval of thyrotoxicosis accompanied by a very low radioiodine uptake. Alternatively, Lyme disease, as an acute process, would expectedly be capable of eliciting the thyroid function abnormalities of “non-thyroidal illnesses” in general, as would acute psychosis, well-known to often resemble Graves’ disease at admission.
