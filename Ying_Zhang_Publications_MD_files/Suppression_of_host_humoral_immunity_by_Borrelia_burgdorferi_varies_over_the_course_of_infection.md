## Content

Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease, utilizes a variety of strategies to evade and suppress the host immune response, which enables it to chronically persist in the host. The resulting immune response is characterized by unusually strong IgM production and a lack of long-term protective immunity. Previous studies in mice have shown that infection withB. burgdorferialso broadly suppresses host antibody responses against unrelated antigens. Here, we show that mice infected withB. burgdorferiand concomitantly immunized with recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein had an abrogated antibody response to the immunization. To further define how long this humoral immune suppression lasts, mice were immunized at 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-infection. Suppression of host antibody production against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peaked at 2 weeks post-infection but continued for all timepoints measured. Antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were also assessed following antibiotic treatment to determine whether this immune suppression persists or resolves following clearance ofB. burgdorferi. Host antibody production against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein returned to baseline following antibiotic treatment; however, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM remained high, comparable to levels found inB. burgdorferi-infected but untreated mice. Thus, our data demonstrate restored IgG responses following antibiotic treatment but persistently elevated IgM levels, indicating lingering effects ofB. burgdorferiinfection on the immune system following treatment.
