## Content

Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is an infectious disease of the nervous system caused byBorrelia burgdorferi (Bb)infection. However, its pathogenesis is not fully understood. We used recombinant BmpA (rBmpA) to stimulate human microglia cell HMC3, then collected the culture supernatant and extracted total RNA from cells, and used the supernatant for cytokine chip, then ELISA and qPCR technology were used to validate the results from cytokine chip. After rBmpA stimulation of microglia, 24 inflammation-related cytokines showed elevated expression. Among them, six cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, and CXCL10) increased significantly in mRNA transcription, three cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL10) concentrations in the cell supernatant increased significantly after the rBmpA stimulation, and CuIIa could inhibit expression of these cytokines. The BmpA can stimulate human microglia to produce large amounts of cytokines, leading to the occurrence of inflammation, which may be closely related to the development of LNB. CuIIa can inhibit BmpA-induced cytokine production in microglia, which may have potential therapeutic effects on LNB.
