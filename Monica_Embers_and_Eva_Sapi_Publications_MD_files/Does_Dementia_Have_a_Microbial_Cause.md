## Content

The potential contribution of pathogenic microbes to dementia-inducing disease is a subject of considerable importance. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurocognitive disease that slowly destroys brain function, leading to cognitive decline and behavioral and psychiatric disorders. The histopathology of AD is associated with neuronal loss and progressive synaptic dysfunction, accompanied by the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in the form of parenchymal plaques and abnormal aggregated tau protein in the form of neurofibrillary tangles. Observational, epidemiological, experimental, and pathological studies have generated evidence for the complexity and possible polymicrobial causality in dementia-inducing diseases. The AD pathogen hypothesis states that pathogens and microbes act as triggers, interacting with genetic factors to initiate the accumulation of Aβ, hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau), and inflammation in the brain. Evidence indicates thatBorreliasp., HSV-1, VZV (HHV-2), HHV-6/7, oral pathogens,Chlamydophila pneumoniae, andCandida albicanscan infect the central nervous system (CNS), evade the immune system, and consequently prevail in the AD brain. Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the multifactorial and overlapping factors that are thought to take part in the etiopathogenesis of dementia; however, the cause of AD remains unclear.
