## Content

Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a disease for which antibody-based detection assays are often required for diagnosis. The variable surface molecule VlsE and IR6, one of its invariable regions, are commonly targeted by the antibody response in infected individuals. A series of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays was performed to comparatively examine the antibody responses of North American LB patients (n = 37) to VlsE and invariable segments of this molecule. Both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG responses to full-length VlsE and to peptides reproducing invariable regions 2, 4, and 6, as well as the invariable domains at the amino and carboxyl termini of VlsE, were assessed. The proportions and specificities of reactivity to the invariable segments were tested by using cognate peptides as competitors for VlsE binding by patient serum antibodies. IR6 epitopes (by the C6 peptide) were found to dominate the response to invariable segments. IR6 (C6)-specific antibodies were detected in 78% of the serum specimens, whereas <40% of patients generated antibodies that bound the N- or C-terminal domain and <12% of patients responded to either IR2 or IR4. Interestingly, 15 of 37 patients generated IgG antibodies that reacted with C6 but not with VlsE. Conversely, IgM responses were frequent for VlsE but not for invariable segments. A representative number of the serum specimens (n = 8) that contained IgG antibodies reacting with both C6 and VlsE was assessed in competition experiments, using C6 as a competitor. Only half of these specimens contained IgG antibodies whose binding to VlsE could be inhibited >50% by competition with the added C6 peptide. The median percent inhibition was 45.5%. These findings indicate that IR6 epitopes are largely concealed from the VlsE molecular surface and that full-length VlsE-based diagnosis likely detects antibodies to conformational and/or variable region epitopes.
