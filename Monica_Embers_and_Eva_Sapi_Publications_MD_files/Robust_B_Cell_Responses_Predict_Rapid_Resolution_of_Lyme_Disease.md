## Content

Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferiinfection) is increasingly recognized as a significant source of morbidity worldwide. Here, we show that blood plasmablasts and CD27-memory B cells are elevated in untreated Lyme disease, with higher plasmablast levels associated with more rapid resolution of clinical symptoms. Stronger serum reactivity to surface proteins and peptides fromB. burgdorferiwas also associated with faster resolution of clinical symptoms. Through molecular identifier-enabled antibody heavy-chain sequencing of bulk B cells and single-cell paired-chain antibody sequencing of blood plasmablasts, we characterized immunoglobulin gene usage patterns specific toB. burgdorferiinfection. Recombinantly expressed antibodies from expanded lineages boundB. burgdorferiantigens, confirming that these clones are driven by the infection. Furthermore, recombinant sequence-derived antibodies were functional, inhibiting growth ofB. burgdorferi in vitro. Elevations and clonal expansion of blood plasmablasts were associated with rapid return to health, while poor plasmablast responses were associated with a longer duration of symptoms following treatment. Plasmablasts induced byB. burgdorferiinfection showed preferential antibody gene segment usage, while bulk sequencing of total B cells revealed convergent CDR3 motifs specific toB. burgdorferi-infected patients. Our results show that robust plasmablast responses encodingBb-static antibodies are associated with more rapid resolution of Lyme disease, and these antibodies could provide the basis for next-generation therapeutics for Lyme disease.
