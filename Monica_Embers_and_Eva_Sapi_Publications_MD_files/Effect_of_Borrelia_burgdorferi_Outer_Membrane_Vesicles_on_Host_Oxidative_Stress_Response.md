## Content

Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are spherical bodies containing proteins and nucleic acids that are released by Gram-negative bacteria, includingBorrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. The functional relationship betweenB. burgdorferiOMVs and host neuron homeostasis is not well understood. The objective of this study was to examine howB. burgdorferiOMVs impact the host cell environment. First, an in vitro model was established by co-culturing human BE2C neuroblastoma cells withB. burgdorferiB31.B. burgdorferiwas able to invade BE2C cells within 24 h. Despite internalization, BE2C cell viability and levels of apoptosis remained unchanged, but resulted in dramatically increased production of MCP-1 and MCP-2 cytokines. Elevated secretion of MCP-1 has previously been associated with changes in oxidative stress. BE2C cell mitochondrial superoxides were reduced as early as 30 min after exposure toB. burgdorferiand OMVs. To rule out whether BE2C cell antioxidant response is the cause of decline in superoxides, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) gene expression was assessed. SOD2 expression was reduced upon exposure toB. burgdorferi, suggesting thatB. burgdorferimight be responsible for superoxide reduction. These results suggest thatB. burgdorferimodulates cell antioxidant defense and immune system reaction in response to the bacterial infection. In summary, these results show thatB. burgdorferiOMVs serve to directly counter superoxide production in BE2C neurons, thereby 'priming' the host environment to supportB. burgdorfericolonization.
