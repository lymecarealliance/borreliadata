## Content

The blacklegged tick,Ixodes scapularis, is the predominant vector ofBorrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease in the USA. Natural hosts ofI. scapularissuch asPeromyscus leucopusare repeatedly infested by these ticks without acquiring tick resistance. However, upon repeated tick infestations, non-natural hosts such as guinea pigs, mount a robust immune response against critical tick salivary antigens and acquire tick resistance able to thwart tick feeding andBorrelia burgdorferitransmission. The salivary targets of acquired tick resistance could serve as vaccine targets to prevent tick feeding and the tick transmission of human pathogens. Currently, there is no animal model able to demonstrate both tick resistance and diverse clinical manifestations of Lyme disease. Non-human primates serve as robust models of human Lyme disease. By evaluating the responses to repeated tick infestation, this animal model could accelerate our ability to define the tick salivary targets of acquired resistance that may serve as vaccines to prevent the tick transmission of human pathogens. Towards this goal, we assessed the development of acquired tick resistance in non-human primates upon repeated tick infestations. We report that following repeated tick infestations, non-human primates do not develop the hallmarks of acquired tick resistance observed in guinea pigs. However, repeated tick infestations elicit immune responses able to impair the tick transmission ofB. burgdorferi. A mechanistic understanding of the protective immune responses will provide insights intoB. burgdorferi-tick-host interactions and additionally contribute to anti-tick vaccine discovery.
