## Content

Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, has been recently shown to form biofilm structures in vitro andin vivo. Biofilms are tightly clustered microbes characterized as resistant aggregations that allow bacteria to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including the administration of antibiotics. Novel antibiotic combinations have recently been identified forB. burgdorferi in vitro, however, due to prohibiting costs, those agents have not been tested in an environment that can mimic the host tissue. Therefore, researchers cannot evaluate their true effectiveness againstB. burgdorferi, especially its biofilm form. A skin ex vivo model system could be ideal for these types of experiments due to its cost effectiveness, reproducibility, and ability to investigate host-microbial interactions. Therefore, the main goal of this study was the establishment of a novel ex vivo murine skin biopsy model forB. burgdorferibiofilm research. Murine skin biopsies were inoculated withB. burgdorferiat various concentrations and cultured in different culture media. Two weeks post-infection, murine skin biopsies were analyzed utilizing immunohistochemical (IHC), reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and various microscopy methods to determineB. burgdorferipresence and forms adopted as well as whether it remained live in the skin tissue explants. Our results showed that murine skin biopsies inoculated with 1 Ã— 107cells ofB. burgdorferiand cultured in BSK-H + 6% rabbit serum media for two weeks yielded not just significant amounts of liveB. burgdorferispirochetes but biofilm forms as well. IHC combined with confocal and atomic force microscopy techniques identified specific biofilm markers and spatial distribution ofB. burgdorferiaggregates in the infected skin tissues, confirming that they are indeed biofilms. In the future, this ex vivo skin model can be used to study development and antibiotic susceptibility ofB. burgdorferibiofilms in efforts to treat Lyme disease effectively.
