## Content

Recent studies have shown thatBorrelia burgdorferican form antibiotic-tolerant persisters in the presence of microbiostatic drugs such as doxycycline. Precisely how this occurs is yet unknown. Our goal was to examine gene transcription byB. burgdorferifollowing doxycycline treatment in an effort to identify both persister-associated genes and possible targets for antimicrobial intervention. To do so, we performed next-generation RNA sequencing on doxycycline-treated spirochetes and treated spirochetes following regrowth, comparing them to untreatedB. burgdorferi. A number of genes were perturbed and most of those which were statistically significant were down-regulated in the treated versus the untreated or treated/re-grown. Genes upregulated in the treatedB. burgdorferiincluded a number ofErpgenes andrplU, a 50S ribosomal protein. Among those genes associated with post-treatment regrowth werebba74(Oms28),bba03, several peptide ABC transporters,ospA, ospB,ospC,dbpAandbba62. Studies are underway to determine if these same genes are perturbed inB. burgdorferitreated with doxycycline in a host environment.
