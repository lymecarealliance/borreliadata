## Content

Uptake of the Lyme disease spirochete by its tick vector requires not only chemical signals present in the tick's saliva but a responsive phenotype by theBorrelia burgdorferiliving in the mammalian host. This is the principle behind xenodiagnosis, wherein pathogen is detected by vector acquisition. To study migration ofB. burgdorferitowardIxodes scapularistick saliva, with the goal of identifying chemoattractant molecules, we tested multiple assays and compared migration of host-adapted spirochetes to those cultured in vitro. We tested mammalian host-adapted spirochetes, along with those grown in culture at 34 Â°C, for their relative attraction to tick saliva or the nutrient N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (D-GlcNAc) and its dimer chitobiose using two different experimental designs. The host-adaptedB. burgdorferishowed greater preference for tick saliva over the nutrients, whereas the cultured incubator-grownB. burgdorferidisplayed no significant attraction to saliva versus a significant response to the nutrients. Our results not only describe a validated migration assay for studies of the Lyme disease agent, but provide a further understanding of how growth conditions and phenotype ofB. burgdorferiare related to vector acquisition.
