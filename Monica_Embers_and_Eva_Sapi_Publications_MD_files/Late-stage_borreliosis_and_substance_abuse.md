## Content

Background:Infectious diseases can contribute to substance abuse. Here, a fatal case of borreliosis and substance abuse is reported. This patient had a history of multiple tick bites and increasing multisystem symptoms, yet diagnosis and treatment were delayed. He experimented with multiple substances including phencyclidine (PCP), an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that opposes NMDA agonism caused byBorreliainfection. During PCP withdrawal, he committed one homicide, two assaults, and suicide.

Methods:Brain tissue was obtained from autopsy and stained for microglial activation and quinolinic acid (QA). Immunoflouresence (IFA) and fluorescencein situhybridization (FISH) were used to identify the presence of pathogens in autopsy tissue.

Results:Autopsy tissue evaluation demonstratedBorreliain the pancreas by IFA and heart by IFA and FISH. Activated microglia and QA were found in the brain, indicating neuroinflammation. It is postulated that PCP withdrawal may exacerbate symptoms produced byBorrelia-induced biochemical imbalances in the brain. This combination may have greatly increased his acute homicidal and suicidal risk. Patient databases also demonstrated the risk of homicide or suicide in patients diagnosed with borreliosis and confirmed multiple symptoms in these patients, including chronic pain, anxiety, and anhedonia.

Conclusions:Late-stage borreliosis is associated with multiple symptoms that may contribute to an increased risk of substance abuse and addictive disorders. More effective diagnosis and treatment of borreliosis, and attention to substance abuse potential may help reduce associated morbidity and mortality in patients with borreliosis, particularly in endemic areas.
