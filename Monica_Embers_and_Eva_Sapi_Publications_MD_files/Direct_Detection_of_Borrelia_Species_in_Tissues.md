## Content

Among the controversies in Lyme disease is the potential for Borrelia spirochetes to persist after guideline-directed antimicrobial therapy. Direct detection of the spirochetes has been essential to explore this phenomenon, given that the infection is often occult and infrequently observed in blood and other body fluids. In addition, the role of spirochetal infection has been examined in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases through detection in affected tissues. In this chapter, we describe methodology to specifically identify Borrelia DNA, RNA, and intact organism (via protein) in tissue for studies of Lyme Borreliosis.
