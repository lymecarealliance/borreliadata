# Essential Oils with High Activity against Stationary Phase Bartonella henselae

## Summary
- 32 essential oils demonstrated high in vitro activity against stationary phase *Bartonella henselae*.
- Cinnamon bark and oregano oils eradicated *B. henselae* within 1 day at 0.032% (v/v).
- Active ingredients carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde were potent even at ≤ 0.01% (v/v).
- Clinical antibiotics such as doxycycline and azithromycin were largely ineffective against stationary phase cells.
- Some essential oils showed potential for targeting both *Borrelia* and *Bartonella* persisters, suggesting use in polymicrobial infections.

## Study Type & Context
- Laboratory-based **in vitro experimental screen** and evaluation of 149 essential oils using a high-throughput viability assay against stationary phase *B. henselae*.
- Focused on persistent forms of the pathogen that are resistant to standard antibiotics.

## Methodology
- SYBR Green I/PI assay was used to assess bacterial viability.
- 149 essential oils screened at 0.25% and 0.5% (v/v) concentrations.
- MIC determined for log-phase bacteria using standard microdilution.
- Time-kill assays performed at 0.032% (v/v) for 25 essential oils over 7 days.
- Active compounds carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde tested at 0.01% and 0.005% (v/v).
- All tests conducted in triplicate.

## Biological or Technical Insights
- Stationary phase *B. henselae* aggregates may protect cells, reducing antibiotic efficacy.
- Essential oils’ lipophilic nature enables penetration of bacterial membranes and biofilms.
- SYBR Green I/PI viability assays are impacted by autofluorescent or volatile oil components; microscopy used for validation.

## Substances & Interventions
- **Highly active oils at 0.032% (v/v)**: oregano, cinnamon bark, mountain savory (winter), clove bud, geranium, elemi, citronella, ylang ylang.
- **Most potent ingredients**: carvacrol (oregano), cinnamaldehyde (cinnamon).
- **Blends**: Health Shield, Bandit, Tic Tox, Stress Relief, Citrus Blast, Deep Forest.
- **Other notable oils**: lemon, bergamot, cedarwood, spearmint, vetiver, fir needle.

## Statistical or Quantitative Results
- MIC of cinnamon bark: <0.008% (v/v).
- MICs ranged from <0.008% to 0.25% (v/v) across oils.
- Carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde eradicated bacteria at ≤0.01% (v/v).
- Residual viability by SYBR Green I/PI and microscopy:
  - Doxycycline: 26–57%
  - Gentamicin: 9–35%
  - Top oils (e.g., frankincense, ylang ylang): 5–11%
- Time-kill CFU assays:
  - Oregano, cinnamon bark, and mountain savory: no detectable CFU after 1 day.
  - Geranium, clove, allspice: eradication within 3–5 days.

## Clinical Implications
- Essential oils may be superior to standard antibiotics against non-growing *B. henselae* persisters.
- Suggest potential use in treating chronic bartonellosis and biofilm-associated infections.
- Indicates synergy potential with antibiotics to improve treatment of persistent infections.

## Hypotheses or Novel Ideas
- Related plant genera (e.g., *Citrus*, *Cinnamomum*, *Origanum*) may share antimicrobial traits.
- Carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde are proposed as candidates for further pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies.
- Combining essential oils with antibiotics may target different bacterial phases more effectively (Yin-Yang model).

## Challenges or Limitations
- Essential oils vary in batch composition.
- Long incubation periods reduce activity due to volatility of oils.
- Lipophilicity may interfere with SYBR Green assay via dissolution of bacterial membranes or aggregates.
- Lack of in vivo data or clinical trials.
