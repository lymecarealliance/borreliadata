# Anti-borreliae Efficacy of Selected Organic Oils and Fatty Acids

## Summary
- Bay leaf oil, Cassia oil, and specific fatty acids (e.g. 13Z,16Z-docosadienoic acid) exhibited strong bactericidal effects against both motile and stationary Borrelia forms.
- Bay leaf oil and Cassia oil, along with their active components (eugenol and cinnamaldehyde), showed partial (~20–30%) eradication of Borrelia biofilms.
- Unsaturated fatty acids were more effective than saturated ones; notably, those in the omega-6, -9, and -12 families.
- The triple antibiotic control (daptomycin + cefoperazone + doxycycline) did not significantly affect biofilm aggregates.
- Active compounds showed time-dependent killing effects and blocked regrowth after 14 days in vitro.

## Study Type & Context
- In vitro lab experiment analyzing bactericidal efficacy of 30 organic oils and 17 fatty acids against Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. and Borrelia garinii in multiple morphological forms.

## Methodology
- Borrelia cultures (B31 and CIP103362 strains) were grown under standard lab conditions.
- Lipid compounds tested at 0.025–1.0% (oils) and 0.025–1.0 mg/mL (fatty acids).
- Viability was assessed via spectrofluorometry and direct dark field microscopy.
- Sub-culturing was used to evaluate regrowth post-treatment.
- Biofilm assessment was done on collagen-coated chambers via crystal violet staining and fluorescence microscopy.
- Statistical analysis used Student’s t-test (p < 0.05).

## Biological or Technical Insights
- Borrelia spp. form various survival morphologies: spirochetes, knob/round-shaped persisters, and biofilm-like aggregates.
- Biofilms and persisters are implicated in chronic Lyme disease and treatment resistance.
- Oils’ efficacy may relate to lipophilicity and impact on membrane integrity.
- Active oil ingredients (eugenol, cinnamaldehyde, chamazulene, thymol) likely disrupt key metabolic functions or membranes.

## Substances & Interventions
### Highly Effective Oils and Their Active Ingredients:
- **Bay leaf oil** (Pimenta racemosa)  
  - Active: **Eugenol**  
  - MIC: 0.0005%, MBC: 0.15%  
  - Eugenol MIC: 0.0003%, MBC: 0.125%

- **Cassia oil** (Cinnamomum cassia)  
  - Active: **Cinnamaldehyde**  
  - MIC: 0.0005%, MBC: 0.15%  
  - Cinnamaldehyde MIC: 0.0003%, MBC: 0.125%

- **Birch oil**  
  - Active: Methyl salicylate  
  - MIC: 0.00075%, MBC: 0.25%

- **Chamomile oil (German)**  
  - Active: Chamazulene  
  - MIC: 0.0075%, MBC: 0.25%

- **Thyme oil**  
  - Active: Thymol  
  - MIC: 0.0005%, MBC: 0.20%

### Effective Fatty Acids:
- **13Z,16Z Docosadienoic acid**  
  - MIC: 0.025 mg/mL, MBC: 0.50 mg/mL  
- **Erucic acid**: MBC: 0.75 mg/mL  
- **Petroselinic acid**: MBC: 0.75 mg/mL  
- **Linoleic acid**: MBC: 1.0 mg/mL  
- Saturated fatty acids were generally ineffective.

## Statistical or Quantitative Results
- MBC90 values ranged from 0.15–1% for effective oils and 0.5–1.0 mg/mL for fatty acids.
- Control antibiotics at 0.03 mg/mL showed ~10–12% viability post-treatment.
- Bay leaf and Cassia oils showed ~0% regrowth in subculture assays; 13Z,16Z-docosadienoic acid showed ~24% regrowth.
- Biofilm eradication: Bay leaf and Cassia oils ~20–30%; triple antibiotic combo ineffective.

## Clinical Implications
- Some essential oils and unsaturated fatty acids are potential non-synthetic alternatives for targeting resistant or persistent forms of Borrelia.
- May serve as adjunct therapies, particularly in cases where antibiotics fail or are contraindicated.
- Possible use in topical or oral formulations for chronic Lyme support.

## Hypotheses or Novel Ideas
- Time-dependent bactericidal action of natural lipids suggests a targeted mechanism rather than nonspecific membrane disruption.
- Lipophilic oils may alter Borrelia's membrane integrity or inhibit key metabolic pathways.
- Unsaturated fatty acids (especially C18–C22) could act via surfactant-like mechanisms or via oxidative byproducts.

## Challenges or Limitations
- No in vivo or clinical validation of findings.
- Pharmacokinetics and toxicity in humans are unknown.
- Some regrowth occurred with fatty acids despite initial effectiveness.
- Further research is needed to explore safety, metabolism, and delivery mechanisms.
