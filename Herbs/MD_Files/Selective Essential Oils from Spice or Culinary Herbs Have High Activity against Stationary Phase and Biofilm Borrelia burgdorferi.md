# Selective Essential Oils from Spice or Culinary Herbs Have High Activity against Stationary Phase and Biofilm *Borrelia burgdorferi*

## Summary
- Some essential oils (e.g., oregano, cinnamon bark, clove bud) exhibit strong activity against stationary phase *B. burgdorferi*, surpassing standard antibiotics like daptomycin.
- The most active essential oils disrupted biofilms and fully sterilized cultures at low concentrations (as low as 0.05% v/v).
- Carvacrol, a compound in oregano oil, was identified as the key active ingredient and outperformed daptomycin both in vitro and in subculture regrowth prevention.
- Several oils showed autofluorescence interference in viability assays but were validated with fluorescence microscopy.
- The results suggest potential new directions for treating persistent Lyme disease caused by antibiotic-tolerant persister forms of *B. burgdorferi*.

## Study Type & Context
- In vitro laboratory study using a stationary-phase culture of *Borrelia burgdorferi* as a model for persister forms.

## Methodology
- 34 essential oils and 3 major components (carvacrol, p-cymene, α-terpinene) tested against 7-day-old stationary phase *B. burgdorferi* cultures.
- SYBR Green I/PI viability assay used, combined with fluorescence microscopy.
- Concentrations tested: 1%, 0.5%, 0.25%, 0.125%, 0.1%, and 0.05% (v/v).
- Subculture studies performed post-treatment to evaluate viability and regrowth.
- Control antibiotics: Daptomycin (Dap), Cefuroxime (CefU), and Doxycycline (Dox).

## Biological or Technical Insights
- Persister forms include round bodies, microcolonies, and biofilm-like aggregates.
- Essential oils disrupted biofilm structures, unlike daptomycin which killed cells but did not break biofilms.
- Carvacrol demonstrated both membrane disruption capability and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.
- Essential oils with strong autofluorescence (e.g., lemongrass) affected fluorescence assay accuracy and required microscopy validation.

## Clinical Observations or Patient Data
- None; this was an in vitro lab study.

## Substances & Interventions
- Most potent essential oils (with effective concentrations listed as % v/v):
  - Oregano (*Origanum vulgare*): effective at ≥0.05%
  - Cinnamon Bark (*Cinnamomum zeylanicum*): effective at ≥0.05%
  - Clove Bud (*Syzygium aromaticum*): effective at ≥0.1%
- Key compound:
  - **Carvacrol**: MIC against replicating *B. burgdorferi*: 0.16–0.31 µg/mL
    - At 0.05% (3.2 µM): full eradication of stationary phase cells
    - At 0.1% (6.4 µM): 2% residual viability
- Others tested: citronella, wintergreen, geranium bourbon, etc., with varying lesser activity

## Statistical or Quantitative Results
- Residual viability measured via SYBR Green I/PI assay (fluorescence ratio) and confirmed with microscopy.
- Top essential oils residual viability at 0.1% (v/v):
  - Oregano: 8% (microscopy)
  - Cinnamon Bark: 55% (microscopy)
  - Clove Bud: 33% (microscopy)
- Carvacrol:
  - At 0.1% (6.4 µM): 2% viability
  - At 0.05% (3.2 µM): sterilizing effect with no regrowth
- Control: Daptomycin at 5–40 µM resulted in 22–45% residual viability.

## Clinical Implications
- Essential oils, particularly oregano oil and carvacrol, may offer novel treatment avenues for persistent Lyme disease where conventional antibiotics fail.
- These agents could potentially be used in combination regimens or explored for oral or topical formulations.
- Carvacrol's ability to penetrate the blood–brain barrier makes it a particularly promising candidate for further investigation.

## Hypotheses or Novel Ideas
- Essential oils may dissolve dead bacteria, potentially explaining discrepancies in residual viability vs. regrowth.
- Carvacrol may cause irreversible damage even to non-culturable but viable *B. burgdorferi* cells.
- Combining essential oils with antibiotics or each other may enhance anti-persister efficacy.

## Challenges or Limitations
- Autofluorescence interfered with fluorescence-based assays for some oils; microscopy was required for validation.
- In vivo efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and optimal dosing remain unknown.
- Essential oil composition variability requires standardization or isolation of active components for future development.
