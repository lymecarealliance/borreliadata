## Content

Difficulties in diagnosis of late stages of Lyme disease include low sensitivity of serological testing and late inclusion of Lyme disease in the differential diagnosis. Longer treatment modalities may have to be considered in order to improve clinical outcome of late disease stages. These difficulties clinical cases of Lyme borreliosis. The different clinical cases illustrate several aspects of late borreliosis: false negative serology due to narrow antigen composition of the used ELISA format, the need for prolonged antibiotic treatment in chronic or recurrent forms and typical presentations of late Lyme disease, such as lymphocytic meningo-encephalitis and polyradiculoneuritis.

## Editorial Summary and Interpretation (Added for Database Clarity)

Late-stage Lyme disease can produce false negative results on antibody tests, especially when ELISA formats use a narrow set of antigens. In several reviewed cases, diagnosis was delayed because Lyme disease was not initially considered. Prolonged antibiotic treatment was needed to improve outcomes in chronic and recurrent cases. Neurological symptoms like lymphocytic meningo-encephalitis and polyradiculoneuritis were observed as part of late Lyme disease.
