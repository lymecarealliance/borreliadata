## Content

A case of a female patient suffering from Lyme arthritis (LA) without elevated antibody levels to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is reported. Seronegative Lyme arthritis was diagnosed based on the classic clinical manifestations and DNA-detected Borrelia garinii in blood and synovial fluid of the patient, after all other possible causes of the disease had been ruled out. The disease was resistant to the first treatment with antibacterial agents. Six months after the therapy, arthritis still persisted and DNA of Borrelia garinii was repeatedly detected in the synovial fluid and the tissue of the patient. At the same time, antigens or parts of spirochaetes were detected by electron microscopy in the synovial fluid, the tissue and the blood of the patient. The patient was then repeatedly treated by antibiotics and synovectomy has been performed.
