## Content

We report a case of Lyme borreliosis. Culture of skin biopsy was positive for Borrelia garinii, despite repeated prior treatment with antibiotics. The patient had travelled in Europe 17 months before the onset of symptoms, but the clinical details indicate that the organism could have been acquired in Australia. The results of conventional serological and histopathological tests were negative, despite an illness duration of at least two years.
