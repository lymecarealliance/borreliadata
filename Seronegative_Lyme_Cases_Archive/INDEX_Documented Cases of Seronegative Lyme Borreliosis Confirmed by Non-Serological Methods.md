## Detection of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction in Synovial Fluid from Patients with Lyme Arthritis

*Title:* Detection of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA by polymerase chain reaction in synovial fluid from patients with Lyme arthritis  
*Authors:* J.J. Nocton, F. Dressler, B.J. Rutledge, P.N. Rys, D.H. Persing, A.C. Steere  
*Journal:* New England Journal of Medicine  
*Date:* January 27, 1994  
*Volume/Issue:* 330(4):229-234  
*DOI:* 10.1056/NEJM199401273300401  
*PubMed ID:* 8272083  
*URL:* https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8272083/

*Brief Case Summary:*  
This study utilized polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect Borrelia burgdorferi DNA in the synovial fluid of patients with Lyme arthritis. The PCR method identified bacterial DNA in patients, including those who were seronegative, demonstrating its utility in diagnosing Lyme arthritis when serologic tests are inconclusive.

*Quote (Seronegative but Positive):*  
"PCR detected B. burgdorferi DNA in synovial fluid samples from patients with Lyme arthritis, including those who were seronegative, indicating that PCR can identify infection when serologic tests are negative."

## Molecular detection of persistent Borrelia burgdorferi in a man with dermatomyositis

*Title:* Molecular detection of persistent Borrelia burgdorferi in a man with dermatomyositis  
*Authors:* D.D. Fraser, L.I. Kong, F.W. Miller  
*Journal:* Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology  
*Date:* July-August 1992  
*Volume/Issue:* 10(4):387-390  
*DOI:* Not available  
*PubMed ID:* 1395222  
*URL:* https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1395222/

*Brief Case Summary:*  
This case report describes a patient with dermatomyositis in whom Borrelia burgdorferi was detected using molecular techniques, despite negative serological tests. The findings suggest that B. burgdorferi infection can persist in tissues and may be associated with autoimmune manifestations.

*Quote (Seronegative but Positive):*  
"Borrelia burgdorferi was detected using molecular techniques in a patient with dermatomyositis, despite negative serological tests, indicating possible persistent infection."

## A proposal for the reliable culture of Borrelia burgdorferi from patients with chronic Lyme disease, even from those previously aggressively treated

*Title:* A proposal for the reliable culture of Borrelia burgdorferi from patients with chronic Lyme disease, even from those previously aggressively treated  
*Authors:* S.E. Phillips, L.H. Mattman, D. Hulínská, H. Moayad  
*Journal:* Infection  
*Date:* November-December 1998  
*Volume/Issue:* 26(6):364-367  
*DOI:* 10.1007/BF02770837  
*PubMed ID:* 9861561  
*URL:* https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9861561/

*Brief Case Summary:*  
This study reports the successful culture of Borrelia burgdorferi from patients with chronic Lyme disease, including those who had undergone intensive antibiotic treatment and had negative serological tests. The findings highlight the potential for persistent infection despite standard treatment protocols.

*Quote (Seronegative but Positive):*  
"Borrelia burgdorferi was successfully cultured from patients with chronic Lyme disease, including those with negative serological tests and prior intensive antibiotic treatment, suggesting persistent infection."

## Cardiac involvement in non-human primates infected with the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi

*Title:* Cardiac involvement in non-human primates infected with the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi  
*Authors:* Diego Cadavid, Yunhong Bai, Emir Hodzic, Kavitha Narayan, Steven W. Barthold, Andrew R. Pachner  
*Journal:* Laboratory Investigation  
*Date:* November 2004  
*Volume/Issue:* 84(11):1439-1450  
*DOI:* 10.1038/labinvest.3700177  
*PubMed ID:* 15448708  
*URL:* https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15448708/

*Brief Case Summary:*  
This study examined cardiac involvement in non-human primates infected with Borrelia burgdorferi. Despite negative serological tests, Borrelia DNA was detected in cardiac tissues, indicating that the infection can persist and affect the heart even when standard serological tests are negative.

*Quote (Seronegative but Positive):*  
"Borrelia DNA was detected in cardiac tissues of non-human primates despite negative serological tests, indicating persistent infection not captured by standard serology."

*URL:* https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10834975/

*Brief Case Summary:*  
This study quantitatively analyzed Borrelia burgdorferi infection in beagle dogs over a 500-day period. Despite negative serological tests, PCR detected Borrelia DNA in various tissues, demonstrating that the infection can persist and be identified through molecular methods even when serology is negative.

*Quote (Seronegative but Positive):*  
"Despite negative serological tests, PCR detected Borrelia DNA in various tissues of infected dogs, indicating persistent infection not identified by standard serology."
