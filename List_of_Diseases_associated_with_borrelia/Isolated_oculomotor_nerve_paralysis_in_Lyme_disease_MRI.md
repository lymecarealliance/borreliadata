## Abstract

Lyme disease is a cause of illness involving multiple organ systems, including, in 10-15 % of cases, the nervous system. Peripheral radiculoneuritis, cranial neuritis, encephalitis and myelitis are among the neurological manifestations found in the second and third stages. We present the MRI findings in isolated oculomotor nerve involvement by Lyme disease and discuss the differential diagnosis.
