## Abstract

Background:Although the frequency of Lyme carditis is not high, it is one of the most challenging conditions in terms of diagnosis. No long-term studies that would help expand our body of knowledge concerning the circumstances of its development and the natural course of this form of Lyme borreliosis (LB), the most widespread anthropozoonosis in Central Europe, have been reported to date.

Aim:The authors sought to describe and assess the consequences of a less common form of Lyme carditis (LC). An assessment of the following aspects was made: a) the forms, natural history and sequelae of the less common clinical appearances of LC, b) the role of antibiotic therapy with reference to the late manifestations of LB.

Methods:Three patients were selected from a group of 60 consecutive patients with demonstrated LC during a follow-up period from 1987 to 2000. Patient no. 1 was being followed for myocarditis with frequent ventricular extrasystoles, patient no. 2 for pericarditis, and patient no. 3 for dilated cardiomyopathy as a late manifestation of LB. In addition to routine examination at entry, the patients were subjected to a standard 12-lead ECG, continuous 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring, exercise testing (bicycle ergometry), investigations of antibodies using ELISA and Western blot, investigation of thyroid (T3, T4, TSH tests) and mineral levels.

Results:The study showed no significant correlation between the clinical course and levels of specific antibodies. It confirmed the concept that inadequate or no therapy with antibiotics in the initial stage of the disease has a significant effect on the development of late sequelae.

Conclusion:Based on the long-term treatment of three patients with less common, yet clinically urgent findings, the authors conclude that even a relatively serious clinical course is associated with no major limitations for affected individuals after an interval of several years.
