## Abstract

A 55-year-old man with an onset and course of neurological symptoms of a progressive stroke was found to have a CNS infection caused by the borrelia spirochete. Almost complete recovery was seen after intravenous infusion of bencylpenicillin. Elevated borrelia IgG antibody titers could be seen for long time after recovery. The possibility of an infection due to neuroborreliosis must be considered. If CT scan doesn't show any focal ischemic or hemorrhagic area further investigation with lumbar puncture is necessary in stroke patients.
