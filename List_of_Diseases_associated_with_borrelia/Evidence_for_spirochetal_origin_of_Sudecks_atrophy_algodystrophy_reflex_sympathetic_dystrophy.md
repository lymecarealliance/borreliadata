## Abstract

Four female patients with Sudeck's atrophy (SA) were evaluated at our department. Sera of all patients were investigated for antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi. In all patients elevated IgG antibody titers and in one patient also elevated IgM titer were found. In one patient structures identical with B. burgdorferi could be detected on histological sections from the skin of the affected limb. Our data and those of other authors suggest that a spirochetal infection can be regarded as an important etiopathogenetic factor in the development of SA.
