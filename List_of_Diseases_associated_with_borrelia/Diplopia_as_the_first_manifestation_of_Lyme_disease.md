## Abstract

Case report:We report a case of Lyme disease with diplopia as the first manifestation, without systemic symptoms in contrast with other cases of this disease. The serodiagnosis was confirmed by ELISA analysis and evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) antibodies. Symptoms readily vanished after the introduction of antibiotherapy.

Discussion:Lyme disease is an infectious multi-systemic disorder caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Neuro-ophthalmological manifestations occur during the second stage of the illness in extremely variable clinical forms.
