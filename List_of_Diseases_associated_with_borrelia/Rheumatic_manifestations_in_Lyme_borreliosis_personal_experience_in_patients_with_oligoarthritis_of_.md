## Abstract

Lyme borreliosis is an infectious illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted by tick vectors. A prospective study was performed from January 1990, to investigate whether Lyme arthritis might have been undetected among patients with (unclassified arthritis) oligoarthritis of "unknown" aetiology. 210 patients were tested for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi: 82 patients with oligoarthritis of "unknown" aetiology; 52 patients with Reiter's syndrome; 20 patients with seronegative, B-27 positive oligoarthritis and 56 controls. Serological testing for Borrelia burgdorferi was performed by indirect immunofluorescence assay. The occurrence of positive antibodies (1:80) in 11 (13.4%) patients with arthritis of "unknown" aetiology was significantly different from the combined control group (1.6%) (p < 0.05). Four out of 11 patients remembered a tick bite, two out of 11 patients developed erythema migrans after 3 to 10 days. Six weeks later 2 patients developed oligoarthritis and one patient after a month. In the remaining 8 patients arthritis was the first sign of the disease. Knees were most commonly affected (90%). Radiographic abnormalities (osteoporosis, soft tissue swelling) were noted in 3 patients. The synovial fluid findings were typical for inflammatory arthritides in 6 patients. The diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis was made according to following data: origin from an area endemic for Lyme borreliosis, tick bite, erythema migrans, significant levels of the antibodies to the Borrelia burgdorferi and oligoarthritis. It can be concluded that arthritis may be the main manifestation of Borrelia burgdorferi infection.
