## Abstract

Parry-Romberg syndrome (PRS) or progressive hemifacial atrophy is a rare entity characterized by unilateral atrophy of the skin, subcutaneous tissue and sometimes bone and cartilage. Although this syndrome has overlapping features of scleroderma 'en coup de sabre', it shows little or no sclerosis and may affect the entire distribution of the trigeminal nerve including the eye and tongue. As the pathogenesis is unknown, no effective therapy exists. We present here the third case of PRS associated with borreliosis and more interestingly two cases whose progressive course have been stabilized with gel PUVA therapy.
