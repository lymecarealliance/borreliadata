## Abstract

Acute interruption of circulation in the distal fingers can be both expression of an embolic event as well as the first manifestation of a vasculitis or collagenosis. The search for its cause is frequently difficult. In many cases a specialized analysis of the coagulation system as well as diagnostics such as ultrasound scan of the heart or a systematic antibody scanning do not reveal the origin of an embolus or the underlying disorder. On the basis of a case-report we would like to focus on a possible context between an infection of Borrelias stage III and consecutive deterioration of peripheral arterial perfusion in the fingers. Besides Jo-1- and positive sceleton-muscle-antibodies there were no serological and clinical indications for an autoimmune disease. It was possible to avoid acral necrosis by means of an antibiotic, immunosuppressive and rheological therapeutic concept. We recommend to control the borellia-antibody-level in cases of obscure threatening peripheral necrosis caused by arterial perfusion stop.
