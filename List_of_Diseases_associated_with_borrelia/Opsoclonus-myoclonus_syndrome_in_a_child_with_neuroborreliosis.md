## Abstract

Opsoclonus-myoclonus is a rare neurological syndrome affecting children and adults. In children it occurs as a parainfectious process or a paraneoplastic syndrome in association with neuroblastoma. Here we report it presenting as an unusual neurological manifestation of Lyme borreliosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report which describes recovery from this syndrome in a child.
