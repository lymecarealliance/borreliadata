## Abstract

We report a 19-year-old patient who presented with an acute encephalopathy manifested by catatonia. We isolated Borrelia burgdorferi from the CSF and demonstrated intrathecal production of IgG antibodies against B burgdorferi. The patient completely recovered after intravenous ceftriaxone therapy.
