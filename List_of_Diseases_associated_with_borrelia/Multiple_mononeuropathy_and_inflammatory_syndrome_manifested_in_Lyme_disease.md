## Abstract

Meningo-radiculitis is the most common peripheral nerve system involvement of Lyme disease. We report the observation of a 73 year-old woman presenting a subacute multiple mononeuropathy and a severe inflammatory syndrome. Diagnosis of Lyme disease was confirmed by a lymphocytic meningitis with positive serologic results in the cerebrospinal fluid. Nerve biopsy showed inflammatory cells spreading along the endoneurium. This case report emphasizes that Lyme disease may present as a multiple mononeuropathy mimicking a vasculitic neuropathy.
