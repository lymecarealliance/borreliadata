## Abstract

A patient eventually found to have Lyme arthritis presented with a symmetrical polyarthritis clinically resembling both rheumatoid arthritis and an enthesopathy but with a negative RA latex test. A history of tick bite was obtained only on followup questioning. Her Lyme serology was positive and her response to antibiotic treatment was complete.
