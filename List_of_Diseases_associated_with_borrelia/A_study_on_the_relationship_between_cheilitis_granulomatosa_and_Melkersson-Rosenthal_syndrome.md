## Abstract

Serum anti Borrelia Burgdorferi (BB) antibody of 18 patients with cheilitis granulomatosa (CG) and 5 patients with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) have been examined and positive results are present in 14 patients with CG(77.8%) and 4 patients with MRS(80%). According to histopathological features the lesions show characteristics of spirochetes diseases. It suggests that CG and MRS are all caused by spirochetes.
