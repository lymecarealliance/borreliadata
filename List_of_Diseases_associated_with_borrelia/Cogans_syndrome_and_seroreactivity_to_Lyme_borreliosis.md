## Abstract

We document the case of a young woman with bilateral nonluetic, interstitial keratitis, vestibuloauditory problems, and bilateral recurrent facial palsies, who had strongly positive serologic tests of Lyme borreliosis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of positive serologic tests for Borrelia burgdorferi in a patient with Cogan's syndrome.
