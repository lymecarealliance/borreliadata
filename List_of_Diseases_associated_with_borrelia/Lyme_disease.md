## Abstract

A 29-year-old male tennis player was examined for neck pain, limited mobility, and right elbow pain. The patient was treated for cervical facet syndrome by chiropractic manipulative therapy (CMT) for a period of 6 weeks. After this time the patient had a relapse of cervical pain, spinal myofascitis, dermatitis and migratory arthropathy. Several specialists were consulted throughout the case including a rheumatologist, and a tentative diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis and fibromyalgia was made. A follow-up blood evaluation led to a new diagnosis of Lyme disease.
