## Abstract

Lyme borreliosis is currently suspected to be capable of mimicking nearly all known neurologic symptoms and disease entities. The goal of our study is to define the associated anamnestic, clinical and laboratory findings in aseptic meningitis and Lyme borreliosis in childhood by a meta-analysis of recent literature and of our own data. We defined by means of 63 cases derived of 10 publications and own data a list of mainly rather unspecific parameters like insidious onset, fever, mild meningism, encephalitic symptoms and cranial nerve involvement. Mere neurologic presentation without ECM, arthritis or even an anamnestic insect-bite seems to be most frequent. Retrospective studies, however, can not sufficiently characterize the clinical picture of aseptic meningitis in Lyme borreliosis.
