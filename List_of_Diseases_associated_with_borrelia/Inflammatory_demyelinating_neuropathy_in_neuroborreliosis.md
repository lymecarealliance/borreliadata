## Abstract

A patient with acute onset of radicular pain developed an asymmetric neuropathy within a few weeks. Neurophysiology and nerve biopsy findings revealed a demyelinating neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid showed mild pleocytosis, increased protein levels and elevated antibody titers against Borrelia burgdorferi suggesting Lyme neuroborreliosis. Although peripheral nervous system complications of Lyme borreliosis are common, the association with chronic demyelinating neuropathy has not been described before.
