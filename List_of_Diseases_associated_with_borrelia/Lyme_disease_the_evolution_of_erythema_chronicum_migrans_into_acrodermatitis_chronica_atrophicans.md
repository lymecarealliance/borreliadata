## Abstract

Erythema chronicum migrans and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans are both recognized to be lesions associated with Lyme disease, although they are thought to be distinct entities. In this paper, the clear evolution of erythema chronicum migrans into acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is demonstrated.
