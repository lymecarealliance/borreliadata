## Abstract

Alopecia occurring after febrile bacterial and viral infection is a phenomenon well known since the beginning of the century. To evaluate the occurrence of alopecia in tick transmitted disease, 23 adult patients with Lyme meningitis and 71 patients with tick-borne encephalitis were included in a prospective study and were followed up for one year. Diffuse alopecia occurred within three months after the outbreak of disease in 3 out of 23 (13%) patients with Lyme meningitis and in 40 out of 71 (56.3%) patients with tick-borne encephalitis. The mean duration of alopecia was 2 to 3 months and alopecia was reversible in all patients.
