## Abstract

A 23-year-old man experienced dysesthesia of the distal parts of four limbs and spilling of drinking water from the right corner of his mouth. He also experienced low grade fever, headache, and nausea. Neurological examination showed weakness of the right frontal, orbicularis oculi and orbicularis oris muscles, atrophy and weakness of the interosseous muscles in both upper limbs and dysesthesia in the distal parts of four limbs. Las√©gue's sign was also positive on the left side. Examination of CSF showed lymphocytic pleocytosis and an increase of total protein. Serum antibody against Borrelia garinii was positive as determined by ELISA. The patient was diagnosed as a case of Lyme disease. His symptoms were not alleviated by administration of ceftriaxone (2 g/day) for 15 days, and dermatitis of nail roots appeared. Following administration of penicillin G at a high dose (12 million units/day) for 20 days, both neurologic symptoms and dermatitis were alleviated. Since B. garinii was reported to move preferentially toward the sites of low temperature, dermatitis of nail roots may be one of the characteristic features of Lyme disease caused by B. garinii.
