## Abstract

We report a case of Lyme disease presenting as an oculomotor nerve palsy and meningitis. T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance images showed marked enhancement of the right third, fifth and sixth nerves. This case illustrates neuroradiological features of cranial nerves during neuroborreliosis.
