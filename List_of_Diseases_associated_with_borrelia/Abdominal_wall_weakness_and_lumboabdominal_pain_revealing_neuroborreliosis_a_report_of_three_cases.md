## Abstract

The authors report three cases of thoracic radiculoneuropathy disclosing neuroborreliosis. All three patients had low back and abdominal pain and two had marked abdominal wall paresis. EMG confirmed a motor involvement of the lower thoracic roots and CSF analysis revealed a lymphocytic meningitis in all three cases. Antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi were present in both the serum and the CSF. A favourable outcome was obtained in all three patients with appropriate antibiotherapy. The differential diagnosis of this misleading presentation is discussed.
