## Abstract

Background:Neurological symptoms develop in 10-20% of children suffered borreliosis (LD).

Aim of the study:It was a presentation of motoric disturbances of neuroboreliosis in children.

Material and methods:Children with neuroborreliosis and other neurological diseases were admitted to the University hospital during 2005-2007. Of these 13 patients, there were 9 males and 4 females, ranging in age between 3-17 years. Neurological diagnostic was performed using ELISA Biomedica kit and western blot bands. A 2-6 week sequential treatment with either iv ceftazidime or amoxicillin and oral doxycycline or amoxicillin was provided. Children were monitored regularly during the next 4-36 months.

Results:The 13 children with neuroborreliosis constitute 0.5% of the pediatric neurology department's patients. The clinical manifestation of LD were usual and unusual from patient to patient. They included four cases of facial nerve paralysis (with bilateral paralysis in one case), in three cases transverse myelitis and in a single case, hemiparesis, and oculomotor nerve paresis. In 9/13 children motoric disturbances of neuroboreliosis was diagnosed indeed. The antibiotic treatment was successful in 6 patients and only partially effective in 3 children with facial nerve paralysis.

Conclusion:The most common symptoms of neuroborreliosis in children was motoric dysfunction.
