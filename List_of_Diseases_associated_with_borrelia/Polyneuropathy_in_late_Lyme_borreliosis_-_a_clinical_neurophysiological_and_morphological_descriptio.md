## Abstract

In a prospective study, detailed clinical and neurophysiological examinations were performed in 17 patients with polyneuropathy associated with the late borrelial manifestation acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA). Similar clinical and neurophysiological signs were found in most of the patients. The findings were those of a sensory polyneuropathy, mainly affecting large nerve fibres. Marked abnormality of vibration threshold was a common finding and in 4 patients this raised a suspicion of spinal cord engagement, in addition to a polyneuropathy. Sural nerve biopsy, performed in 3 of the patients, showed a mainly axonal neuropathy. Biopsy findings did not confirm earlier reports of vasculitis of epineural vessels in ACA-associated polyneuropathy.
