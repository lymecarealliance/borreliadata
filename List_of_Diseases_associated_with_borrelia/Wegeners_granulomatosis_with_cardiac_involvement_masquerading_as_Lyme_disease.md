## Abstract

Cardiac conduction disease is an infrequent complication of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). We describe a case demonstrating an association between WG and complete atrioventricular dissociation. This manifestation was initially interpreted as Lyme disease based on these cardiac findings, arthritis, myalgias and positive Lyme serology. The clinical overlap between these disorders and the appropriate use of respective serologies is discussed.
