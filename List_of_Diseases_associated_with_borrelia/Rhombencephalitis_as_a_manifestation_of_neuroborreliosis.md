## Abstract

Rhombencephalitis is a rare neurological manifestation of stage II of Lyme disease. We presented two cases with no recollection of tick bite nor erythema migrans and with cranial nerve nuclei, pyramidal tract and cerebellar tracts involvement of sudden onset, inflammatory syndrome in cerebrospinal liquor, positive oligoclonal bands and elevated IgG index. A spontaneous remission occurred in both cases, but antibiotic was given intravenously for prevention of relapses and disease progression.
