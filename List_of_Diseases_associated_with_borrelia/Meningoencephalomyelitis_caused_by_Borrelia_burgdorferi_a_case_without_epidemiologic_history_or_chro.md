## Abstract

A patient is reported with meningoencephalomyelitis with polyradiculitis caused by Borrelia burgdorferi infection. Neurological features developed without previously known tick bite nor the characteristic skin lesion, chronic migratory erythema (CME). The vector of the disease (the tick Ixodes ricinus) exists in Spain, but only one case of meningopolyradiculitis with CME has been reported in Asturias. Our case stresses that B. burgdorferi infection should be suspected in cases of meningoencephalomyelitis or meningopolyradiculitis even without previous skin or joint lesion.
