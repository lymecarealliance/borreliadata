## Abstract

Classic variants of cutaneous borreliosis are erythema chronicum migrans (ECM), lymphadenosis benigna cutis (LBC) and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA). Other dermatoses have been reported in the literature as possibly linked to borreliosis. A 59-year old female patient was seen in the late phases of cutaneous borreliosis with histologically confirmed ACA. In addition, prominent livedo racemosa was seen on the legs, also showing tissue changes similar to those of ACA. Borrelia burgdorferi infection was serologically confirmed by the presence of anti-IgM and anti-IgG antibodies. The clinical spectrum of late cutaneous borreliosis should be enlarged to include livedo racemosa.
