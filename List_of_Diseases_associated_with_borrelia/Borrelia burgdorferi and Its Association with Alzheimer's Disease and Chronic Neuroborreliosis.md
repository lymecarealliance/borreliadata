The cause of most Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases remains unknown, though infection has been suggested as a factor. Spirochetes, such as *Treponema pallidum*, are known to cause dementia and inflammation. In this study, spirochetes were found in the blood, CSF, and brain of AD patients but not in controls. Genetic analysis identified the agent as *Borrelia burgdorferi*. Borrelia antigens and genes co-localized with beta-amyloid plaques. The findings suggest that *B. burgdorferi* may persist in the brain and contribute to AD pathology, analogous to *T. pallidum* in syphilitic dementia.

This study investigated whether atypical and cystic forms of *Borrelia burgdorferi*—like those seen in *T. pallidum*—could persist in chronic Lyme neuroborreliosis. In vitro experiments and brain samples from three patients revealed pleomorphic forms, including cystic and granular variants. These forms, induced by environmental stressors, were found intracellularly in neurons and astrocytes. Markers of neuroinflammation such as activated microglia and reactive astrocytes were observed. These findings support the notion that resistant forms of *B. burgdorferi* persist in the brain and may underlie prolonged neurological symptoms and cellular damage.

### Content

This hypothesis suggests that cystic forms of *Borrelia burgdorferi* are the origin of Alzheimer's plaques. The round, pock-marked nature of AD plaques is structurally similar to the cystic forms of *B. burgdorferi*. Traditional views emphasizing amyloid as the primary cause of plaques are questioned. The theory proposes that amyloid may be a byproduct rather than the cause, and round plaques could stem from the spirochete's cystic morphology. It challenges parataxic thinking that assumes co-localization implies causation, proposing a new pathogenic model linking Lyme disease with AD.

This study examined AD and Parkinson’s brain tissues for the presence of *Borrelia burgdorferi*. Using multiple methods, B. burgdorferi antigens and DNA were detected, with notable co-localization with amyloid-β and phospho-tau proteins. Infected mammalian cells showed elevated expression of these proteins post-infection. Additionally, Borrelia biofilms containing alginate were found in the brain. The findings suggest that *B. burgdorferi* may not only persist in the brain but also influence key pathological markers of Alzheimer’s, reinforcing a possible infectious component to neurodegenerative diseases.

### Content

This comprehensive review explores the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be a form of chronic neurospirochetosis. By analyzing data through Koch’s and Hill’s criteria for establishing causality, the author presents strong evidence linking spirochetes—including *Borrelia burgdorferi* and various *Treponema* species—to the development of AD. Spirochetes were detected in over 90% of AD cases using techniques that identify all types of spirochetes, with *B. burgdorferi* specifically found in approximately 25% of AD brains and 13 times more frequent in AD than in controls.

Key findings include:
- Spirochetes were present in senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid-laden arteries.
- Co-infection with multiple spirochete species, especially periodontal *Treponema*, was common.
- In vitro exposure of mammalian cells to spirochetes reproduced AD hallmarks including amyloid and tau pathology.
- In three AD patients, *B. burgdorferi* was cultured from the brain and confirmed through genetic and immunohistochemical methods.
- The presence of spirochetes correlated with chronic inflammation and amyloid deposition similar to that seen in neurosyphilis.

The study concludes that spirochetal infection meets the criteria for a probable causal role in AD. Given the treatability of spirochetal infections, the author advocates for immediate attention and further investigation into infectious etiologies of Alzheimer’s, potentially opening paths for prevention or treatment.
