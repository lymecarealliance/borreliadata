## Abstract

Lyme borreliosis is an infectious disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Neurological complications are frequently reported but the pathogenesis remains largely unknown. We report on a patient with positive borrelia antibodies at ELISA and immunoblotting and with histological and immunofluorescence study of peripheral nerve biopsy consistent with vasculitic neuropathy.
