## Abstract

The authors describe one case of infections sacro-iliitis caused by Borrelia, where the diagnostic procedures by conventional radiology, computerized tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging have not permitted the localization and the assessment of joint inflammatory disease. The bone "theree phases" scintiscan by 99m Technectium-methylene diphosphonate (99mTC-MDP) has made it possible to localize on left sacro-iliac synchondrosis a modification of radioactivity, due to inflammations. Next microbiological studies gave a positive result for borrelia. The authors finish by underlying the importance of the nuclear medicine methods in the screening of infective osteo-arthritis.
