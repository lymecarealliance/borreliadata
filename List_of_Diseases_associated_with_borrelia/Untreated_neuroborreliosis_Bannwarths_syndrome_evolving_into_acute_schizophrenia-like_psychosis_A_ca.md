## Abstract

In general, meningopolyradiculitis (Bannwarth's syndrome, stage 2 of neuroborreliosis) follows a predictable monophasic self-limiting course. In contrast, we report the case of a patient with an untreated meningopolyradiculitis which evolved into acute schizophrenia-like psychosis due to persistent infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. The psychosis resolved within 1 week of treatment with ceftriaxone. This case shows that the usually benign monophasic meningopolyradiculitis may progress to severe CNS complications, which may have implications on current pathophysiological beliefs.
