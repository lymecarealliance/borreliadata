## Abstract

We report three cases of neuroborreliosis presenting with acute respiratory impairment. All the patients had encephalopathy and focal neurological signs with brain stem abnormalities in two. All three patients had respiratory arrest associated with progressive nocturnal hypoventilation or prolonged central apnoea. Tracheostomy and prolonged periods of ventilatory support were necessary in all cases and weaning was complicated by residual central respiratory disturbances. These cases emphasise that Borrelia infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained respiratory failure.
