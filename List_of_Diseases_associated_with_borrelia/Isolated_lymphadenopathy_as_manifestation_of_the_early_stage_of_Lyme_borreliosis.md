## Abstract

The paper reports 4 cases of early Lyme borreliosis which presented as lymphadenopathy at the site of the tick bite. Erythema migrans and dissemination of infection were absent. The diagnosis was verified via diagnostic titer of antibodies to Borrelia. Administration of antibiotics at the stage of lymphadenopathy contributed to better prognosis. One patient did not receive antibacterial treatment in acute disease and had progression with infection dissemination. Regional lymphadenopathy may serve a clinical marker of early Lime borreliosis.
