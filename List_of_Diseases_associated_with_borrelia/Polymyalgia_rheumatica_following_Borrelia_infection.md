## Abstract

The case of a 84-year old woman is presented who developed a polymyalgia rheumatica/giant cell arteritis (PMR/GCA)-syndrome following a tick bite. Elevated titers of IgG-antibodies (indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA) as well as IgM (Immunoblot) against Borrelia burgdorferi antigens were found in her serum. When a total of 19 patients with PMR/GCA-syndrome was tested serologically, elevated or borderline IgG-titers against Borrelia antigens were detected in 12 of them (= 63%). Hence, Borrelia infection may be viewed as a potential trigger mechanism of a PMR/GCA-syndrome.
