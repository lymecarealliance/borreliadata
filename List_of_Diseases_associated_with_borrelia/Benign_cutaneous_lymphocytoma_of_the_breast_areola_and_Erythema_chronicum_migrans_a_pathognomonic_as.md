## Abstract

Background:Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease are mainly cutaneous, neurologic, cardiac and/or located joints. Some dermatologic manifestations are more specific.

Case report:An eight year-old-girl was examined because she suffered from a nodular lesion located on the left breast areola which appeared 3 months earlier. This lesion was associated with an expanding erythematous annular lesion located on the anterior face of thorax and left axillary area, without any lymphadenopathy. The association of this cutaneous lymphocytoma and erythema chronicum migrans was suggestive of Borellia infection despite absence of previous tick bite. Serologic tests (indirect immunofluorescence) were negative, but both lesions disappeared within 2 weeks with ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg/day.

Conclusions:This association is pathognomonic of Lyme disease; serologic tests may be found negative in the early stages of disease.
