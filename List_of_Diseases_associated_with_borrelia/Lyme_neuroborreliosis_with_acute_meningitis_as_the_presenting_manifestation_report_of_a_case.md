## Abstract

To enhance the understanding of Lyme disease, a case of Lyme neuroborreliosis with acute meningitis as the presenting manifestation was reported. The diagnosis was confirmed by elevated serum antibody response to B. burgdorferi using both ELISA and Western blotting, excluding other causes of neurological abnormalities and the typical response of our patient to antibiotics. This case indicates the existence of Lyme disease in Beijing area. If the etiology of a meningitis with lymphocytic pleocytosis is not known, it is important that Lyme neuroborreliosis should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses and detection of antibody to B. burgdorferi in serum and cerebrospinal fluid performed in time. A brief review of the literature including epidemiology, clinical menifestations, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease was made.
