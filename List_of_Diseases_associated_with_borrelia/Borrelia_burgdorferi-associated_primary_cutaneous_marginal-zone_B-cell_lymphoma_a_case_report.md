## Abstract

An association between Borrelia burgdorferi with primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (PCBCL) has long been suspected but just recently, thanks to a polymerase chain reaction technique, it had been possible to demonstrate B. burgdorferi-specific DNA in skin lesions of patients with different PCBCL subtypes. Locating cases of PCBCL that are related to B. burgdorferi infection could be really important for therapeutic implications; in fact, there are several reports of PCBCL responding to antibiotic therapy against B. burgdorferi. We report a case of B. burgdorferi-associated primary cutaneous marginal-zone B-cell lymphoma that, after specific antimicrobial therapy, did not show any clinical regression. We can conclude that additional studies are necessary in order to establish the use of antimicrobial therapy in B. burgdorferi-associated PCBCL.
