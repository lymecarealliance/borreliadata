## Abstract

A 69-year-old male had noticed pruritus on the back for the previous 3-4 years and cutaneous sclerosis with swelling of the dorsum of the neck had developed in the last one and a half years. However, he had never complained of Raynaud's phenomenon of the fingers, dry mouth, or dry eyes. At this first visit to our hospital, he complained of erythematous cutaneous sclerosis with swelling of the dorsum of the neck. Histopathological findings biopsied from the neck showed epidermal hyperplasia with elongation of rete ridges and homogeneous and fibromatous changes of the dermis with dense perivascular cell infiltration consisting of mononuclear cells or lymphocytes with several nests of incontinentia pigmenti. However, there were no sclerotic changes in blood vessels in the upper dermis biopsied from the forearm skin, although slightly homogeneous and fibromatous changes of the dermis were seen. In the clinical course, the cutaneous sclerotic change enlarged to extend to the bottom of the cheek, forearm, and lower legs. These clinical features and histopathological findings led to the diagnosis of generalized morphea. Hematologic examination showed positive anti-Borrelia burgdorferi IgM antibodies, although there were no positive anti-Borrelia burgdorferi IgG antibodies. These results revealed that there can be a close association of localized scleroderma with Borrelia burgdorferi and that generalized morphea may also represent a Borrelia infection.
