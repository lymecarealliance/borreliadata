## Abstract

Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) is a rare condition that includes chaotic multidirectional saccadic eye movements associated with myoclonus and ataxia. In adults, it is usually considered to be an autoimmune disease occurring either in a paraneoplastic context or after central nervous system infection. We report the case of a patient who presented with the classic features of OMS as a manifestation of acute Borrelia burgdorferi infection that was shown both on serum and cerebrospinal fluid examination. The outcome was favourable after prolonged antibiotic treatment. Lyme disease could be added to the list of aetiologies to be screened in OMS, as it would allow effective treatment and avoidance of unnecessary investigations.
