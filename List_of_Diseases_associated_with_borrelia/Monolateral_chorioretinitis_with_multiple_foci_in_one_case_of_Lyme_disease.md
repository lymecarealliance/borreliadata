## Abstract

Lyme disease involves numerous anatomic areas and systems and is caused by a spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. In this article, we describe one case of monolateral chorioretinitis with multiple foci in a 22-year-old myopic man. The diagnosis of this disease was confirmed by positive specific anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies titrated with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method and by serum-conversion occurring approximately six weeks after the end of therapy. Considering the potential effect of this disease on the world's population, we wish to draw attention to its occurrence because it frequently involves ocular structures. Prompt and adequate therapy guarantees complete healing and avoids both short- and long-term complications.
