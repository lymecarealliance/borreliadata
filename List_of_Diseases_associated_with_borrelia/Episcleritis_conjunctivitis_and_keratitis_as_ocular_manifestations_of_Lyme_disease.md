## Abstract

A 35-year-old woman presented with a bilateral palpebral follicular conjunctivitis. Subsequently, she developed a bilateral keratitis and, on a separate occasion, an episcleritis that was associated with a recrudescence of Lyme disease and poor compliance with the antibiotic regimen. Both the keratitis and episcleritis cleared completely after topical corticosteroid therapy and reinstitution of appropriate antibiotic treatment. This report emphasizes the importance of collaboration between internal medicine and ophthalmologic specialists during the long-term management of Lyme disease.
