## Abstract

Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, has ophthalmic manifestations. The authors describe two cases of Lyme keratitis characterized by multiple focal, nebular opacities at varying levels of the stroma which may progress to edema, neovascularization, and scarring. Close observation, in addition to systemic antibiotic therapy, may be sufficient if the visual axis is not involved, and the patient is asymptomatic.
