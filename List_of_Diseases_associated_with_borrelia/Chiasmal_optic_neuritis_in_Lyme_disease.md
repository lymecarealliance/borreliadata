## Abstract

Purpose:To report Lyme disease as the cause of chiasmal optic neuritis in a 10-year-old girl.

Methods:The patient underwent ophthalmologic, laboratory, and imaging examinations.

Results:The patient's history and clinical course were consistent with Lyme disease. Laboratory studies disclosed increased serum Lyme immunoglobulin G titer, which improved after antibiotic treatment.

Conclusion:Lyme disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chiasmal optic neuritis.
