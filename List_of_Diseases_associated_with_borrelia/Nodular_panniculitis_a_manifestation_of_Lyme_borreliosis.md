## Abstract

Infection with Borrelia burgdorferi can induce various skin manifestations. The type of skin manifestation and the histopathological picture depend on the stage of infection and vary from local inflammatory infiltrates to chronic atrophic skin disease. Involvement of subcutaneous tissue has been observed only very rarely. We report on two patients suffering from nodular panniculitis (Pfeifer-Weber-Christian) and present evidence that the disease was caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. In one of the cases Borrelia burgdorferi was repeatedly isolated from skin and subcutaneous tissue biopsies in spite of repeated high-dose therapy with ceftriaxone, Doxycycline and cefotaxime.
