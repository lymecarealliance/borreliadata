## Abstract

The authors describe the case of a 42 years old man, who was implanted a permanent pacemaker on the basis of the sick sinus syndrome, suspected to have been induced by the infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. The review of world literature has indicated that it is an exceptional indication of permanent cardiac stimulation.
