## Abstract

A case of severe myelo-meningo-radiculitis with Lyme neuro-borreliosis is described in a patient aged 33 years suffering from insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. It is essential to examine the cerebro-spinal fluid for Borelia burgdorferi specific intrathecal antibody production if sensory radiculitis persist and, finally, if there are focal motor signs and unexplained lymphocytic pleocytosis in the cerebro-spinal fluid. Early diagnosis is very important in order to shorten the course of the illness and recovery.
