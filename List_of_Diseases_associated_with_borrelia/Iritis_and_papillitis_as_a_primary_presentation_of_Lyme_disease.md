## Abstract

A 9-year-old boy had iridocyclitis and papillitis. Laboratory evaluation revealed a positive Lyme titer. Institution of therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone resulted in regression of the ocular inflammation. Ophthalmologists should consider Lyme disease in the differential diagnosis of iridocyclitis in conjunction with papillitis.
