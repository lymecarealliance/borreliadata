## Abstract

A relationship between Borrelia burgdorferi and the development of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL) has been long discussed. B. burgdorferi DNA has been detected in patients with CBCL and a response of CBCL to antibiotics has been observed. In our patient with a Borrelia infection, a marginal zone lymphoma (SALT) regressed after ceftriaxone therapy. This further case of a combined appearance of CBCL and B. burgdorferi underlines a possible relationship as an example of an infectious trigger in tumorigenesis.
