## Abstract

We report on a 11-year-old boy who had 2 acute hemiparesis episodes over a period of 1 month. He suffered from headache and fatigue since 1 year. He could not remember neither a tick bite nor a local erythematous skin lesion. The diagnosis of neuroborreliosis was based on intrathecal production of specifics antibodies. Furthermore, the CSF/blood glucose ratio was decreased (0.14), which was rarely described. Cranial MRI showed left capsulothalamic inflammation and a vasculitis. The patient was successfully treated by ceftriaxone. Neuroborreliosis should be considered in all children with stroke-like episode, even in the absence of a history of a tick bite.
