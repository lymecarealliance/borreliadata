## Abstract

Purpose:To report a case of Lyme disease that presented with a single nummular unilateral interstitial keratitis.

Methods:Case report and review of the literature.

Results:A 57-year-old black man who had contact with freshly killed deer had a chief complaint of foreign-body sensation in his right eye (OD) that had been diagnosed and treated for herpes simplex stromal keratitis. The patient underwent a systemic workup for interstitial keratitis. All results including RPR and MHA-TP were negative except for Lyme antibody titer (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) 178 U/ml (normal, <159 U/ml).

Conclusion:Interstitial keratitis from Lyme disease has been regarded as a bilateral disease in the literature. We present this infrequent ocular manifestation of Lyme disease as a rare single nummular unilateral presentation.
