## Abstract

Bilateral retrobulbar optic neuritis in young adults are most often caused by demyelinate disease (MS). In all cases where MS was eliminated, we have used selected tests regarding to history, clinical findings and differential diagnosis. Diagnosis of Lyme disease is approved by diagnostic criteria proposed by Center for Control and Prevention of disease. In our case diagnosis of Lyme disease was established by history of illness, clinical findings and positive serlological tests.
