## Abstract

Lyme disease is an infectious multi system disorder caused by the spiroch√®te Borrelia Burgdorferi. Neurologic syndromes occurring during the second stage of the illness are common and the neurologic feature is extremely variable. We report a case of Lyme disease with diplopia. In contrast with most reported cases of ocular motor involvement in Lyme disease, no other systemic symptoms were detected. The serodiagnosis, although mildly positive, was confirmed by western blot antibodies analysis and evaluation of CSF antibodies. Symptoms readily vanished 3 days after the introduction of antibiotherapy. The efficacity of antibiotic therapy on the quality and timing of functional recovery justifies the use of this therapy.
