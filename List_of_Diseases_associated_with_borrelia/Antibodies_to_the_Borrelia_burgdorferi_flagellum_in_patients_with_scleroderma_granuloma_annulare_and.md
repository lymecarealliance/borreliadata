## Abstract

It is generally accepted that cutaneous Lyme borreliosis comprises erythema chronicum migrans, lymphadenosis benigna cutis, and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. In recent years the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi has been associated with a number of other cutaneous disorders. We therefore investigated sera from 175 patients with localized scleroderma (morphea) (n = 64), systemic sclerosis (n = 74), granuloma annulare (n = 16) and porphyria cutanea tarda (n = 21) with the new, highly sensitive and specific Borrelia burgdorferi flagellum ELISA assay. As controls (n = 297) served normal healthy volunteers and patients with other skin diseases. It was found that the distribution of individual antibody values and the median antibody levels were identical in controls and in patients with scleroderma, granuloma annulare and porphyria cutanea tarda. These data do not support the hypothesis of an etiological association between Borrelia burgdorferi infection and scleroderma, granuloma annulare or porphyria cutanea tarda.
