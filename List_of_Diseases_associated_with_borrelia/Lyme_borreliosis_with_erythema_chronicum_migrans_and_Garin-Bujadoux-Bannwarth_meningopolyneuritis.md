## Abstract

A case report is given on a Borrelia burgdorferi infection regarded to be typical because of its clinical course and the diagnosis lately made. The meningopolyneuritis was treated by use of corticosteroids before the serologic detection of Lyme disease. 21 months after infection our patient died of a colon carcinoma. Histological preparation of the brain showed a slight encephalitis we consider as third-stage Lyme borreliosis. We conclude that antibacterial therapy is necessary in the management of Lyme disease, especially after the administration of corticosteroids.
