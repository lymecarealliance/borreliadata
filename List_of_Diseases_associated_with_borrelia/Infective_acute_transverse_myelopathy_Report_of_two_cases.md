## Abstract

Two children with acute transverse myelopathy following adenovirus and Borrelia Burgdorferi infections are presented. The diagnosis stems from the clinical presentation, the determination of specific antibodies in serum and the favorable response to penicillin treatment in the case of neuroborreliosis. Both children made a good recovery. The cerebrospinal fluid examination showed a highly increased myelin basic protein concentration, indicating demyelination.
