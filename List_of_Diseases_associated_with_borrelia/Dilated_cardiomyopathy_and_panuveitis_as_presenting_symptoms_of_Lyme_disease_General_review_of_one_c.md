## Abstract

Introduction:The clinical expression of Lyme disease is highly variable. If a patient presents clinical findings consistent with a systemic Lyme borreliosis, this disease must be considered in an endemic area because of its favorable outcome with adequate treatment.

Exegesis:The authors report and discuss the case of a patient with an unusual history of dilated cardiomyopathy and supraventricular fibrillation followed by bilateral panuveitis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi antigens. The diagnosis of Lyme disease was made after other infectious, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders were excluded by clinical, instrumental and biological investigations. The treatment by ceftriaxone and amoxicillin resolved the ophthalmologic manifestations and improved the cardiac condition.

Conclusion:This report underlines the possibility of an unusual presentation of Lyme disease. Ophthalmologic and cardiac involvement should be known by clinicians.
