## Abstract

Lyme neuroborreliosis is diagnostically challenging because of its diverse manifestations. The well-documented neurologic spectrum includes lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuropathy, and radiculoneuritis in the early disseminated stage; and peripheral neuropathy, chronic encephalomyelitis, and mild encephalopathy in the late persistent stage. This case report describes a 74-year-old man who developed progressive left hemiparesis and facial palsy. The patient was hospitalized to rule out a cerebral vascular accident. The diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis was established with serologic studies. The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and responded with rapid clinical and functional recovery. Lyme neuroborreliosis presenting as hemiparesis has rarely been reported. Prompt diagnosis and treatment appear to facilitate symptomatic relief and prevent persistent neurologic deficits.
