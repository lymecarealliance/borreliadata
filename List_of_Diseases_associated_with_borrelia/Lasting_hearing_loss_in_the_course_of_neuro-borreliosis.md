## Abstract

Lyme borreliosis is spirochetal disease that frequently affects the nervous system months or years after infection giving rise to a varied clinical picture named neuro-borreliosis. We report a case of 47 year old female with progressing hearing loss, tinnitus, paraparesis and ataxia. The disease was beginning six month earlier by weakness of the lower limbs associated with hearing loss. The patient did not remember to be exposed to ticks and did not recall the presence of erythema migrans, arthritis or other systemic signs. CSF was with mononuclear pleocytosis and protein concentration over 600 mg%. Firstly patient was unsuccessfully treated like encephalomeningitis with tbc etiology. Next cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed presence of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi in IgG and IgM class. IgG antibodies in serum were founded. Audiometry electric responses from brain stem showed sensorineural hearing loss. Therapy with ceftriaxone was successful. Because negative tick bile history and many signs from different parts of CNS, relationship of this spirochetal infection and severe otolaryngological and neurological disease was firstly difficult to recognition.
