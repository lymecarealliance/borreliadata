## Abstract

Since 1987 when Januszkiewicz and Kieda first described borreliosis, it is commonly recognized as infection of the nervous system in Poland, especially in north-east region. The diagnosis of the disease is mainly based on typical clinical signs, supported by serological testing. In 14 patients with clinical symptoms of neuroborreliosis CT and MR were performed to evaluate CNS changes. MR examinations were abnormal in 36%. Most patients (60%) presented cerebral atrophy. In 2 cases areas of abnormal signal were identified within cerebral white matter as well as within the brain stem. In the first case it was, recognized as demyelination focus, in second one MR showed evidence of or were suggestive of vascular involvement. In one case symmetrical calcifications were also found in internal capsules. Neuroradiological signs in Lyme disease are not specific. Neuroborreliosis has to be considered when patients present foci of hyperintense signal (T2-weighted images) in white matter and brain stem.
