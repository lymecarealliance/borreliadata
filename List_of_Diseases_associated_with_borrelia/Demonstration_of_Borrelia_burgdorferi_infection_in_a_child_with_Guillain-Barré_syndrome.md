## Abstract

A 4.5-year-old child suffered from rapidly evolving motor weakness with paresthesia and radicular pain in both legs, accompanied by an isolated elevation of protein levels in CSF. Isoelectric focusing revealed oligoclonal IgG produced in the cerebrospinal compartment only. The diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome was confirmed by electrophysiological studies. High antibody titres against Borrelia burgdorferi in the serum and specific antibodies in the CSF were demonstrable by ELISA and immunoblotting. B. burgdorferi specific DNA fragments were demonstrated in urine and CSF by means of a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), thus providing the borrelial aetiology and indicating B. burgdorferi infection. Complete recovery was observed after treatment with high dose immunoglobulin and ceftriaxone and control urine specimens were PCR negative.
