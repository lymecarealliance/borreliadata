## Abstract

The Lyme disease, which was first found in Lyme, USA, in 1975 is an infectious multi-system disorder whose agent, the Borrelia Burgdorferi, was identified in 1983. Various disease manifestations have been reported since them. We report a case of Lyme disease manifestation in the muscle revealed by serious amyotrophy in the scapular muscles, in the neck and in the trunk with scapula alata accompanied by noctural lumbago which is resistant to non stero√Ød anti-inflammatory drugs. Electromyography showed patterns of the myogenic type in the serrate anterior and infraspinous muscles on both sides and patterns of the neurogenic peripheral type in the lower extremities. The histological, immunohistochemical and electron-microscopal studies of the muscle biopsy have been without any pathological result. Creatine kinase and aldolase proved normal. Serological antibodies were not significantly increased. A positive diagnosis was obtained by lumbar puncture which showed lymphocytic meningitis, by demonstrating specific antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid and by Western Blot antibodies analysis. Efficacy of the antibiotic therapy has resulted in a rapid regression of the symptoms, which is a further confirmation of the previous diagnosis.
