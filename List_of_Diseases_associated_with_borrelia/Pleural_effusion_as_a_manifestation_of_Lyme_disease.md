## Abstract

We describe a 37-year-old woman who presented with bilateral pleural effusion combined with intermittent low grade fever. Lyme disease was confirmed by seroreactivities against Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes. The unique clinical findings reveal a rare manifestation with a possible association between B. burgdorferi infection and pleural effusion.
