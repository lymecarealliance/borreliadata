## Abstract

After two seizures, a 13 year-old boy experienced headache, fatigue and loss of appetite over a period of 3 weeks. There was a bilateral papilledema with normal visual acuity. CT and MRI disclosed two ischemic foci, that were interpreted as evidence of vasculitis. High serum levels of IgG and IgM antibodies specific to Borrelia burgdorferi, were present. The patient had attended an outdoor scout camp in a area, in south-east Belgium, known to be endemic for tick-born borreliosis. The clinical symptoms, the levels of the specific antibodies and the radiologic abnormalities responded dramatically to treatment. We believe that seizures in this case were related to cerebral vasculitis. This case confirms the extreme diversity of the neurological manifestations of Borreliosis.
