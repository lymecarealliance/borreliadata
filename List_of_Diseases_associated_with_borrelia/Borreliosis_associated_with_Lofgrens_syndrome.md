## Abstract

A man with positive Borrelia-titres, joint pain, erythema nodosum and fever was treated with penicillin. After finding hilar adenitis LÃ¶fgren's syndrome was thought to be more likely and penicillin was discontinued. Later the patient developed symptoms of neuroborreliosis and S-Borrelia IgG was 10 units. After treatment with doxycycline symptoms disappeared and IgG levels fell.
