## Abstract

Background:Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) infection has been implicated in the development of morphea and lichen sclerosus; however, conflicting results have been reported with different investigational methods from different regions. We looked for evidence of Bb in patients with morphea and lichen sclerosus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of of skin biopsy samples.

Methods:Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin biopsy samples from 10 patients with morphea and 12 patients with lichen sclerosus were investigated by PCR analysis for the presence of Bb.

Results:The presence of Bb DNA was demonstrated in three of 10 patients with morphea and six of 12 patients with lichen sclerosus by nested PCR.

Conclusions:The data obtained in this study suggest that Bb may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of both morphea and lichen sclerosus at least in the western parts of Turkey.
