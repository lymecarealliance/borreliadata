## Abstract

The authors review the literature concerning clinical characteristics of neuroborreliosis with special focus on mental disorders. The patients develop mental disorders during the acute phase of the disease and even after several years. These disorders are often accompanied with various neurological syndromes. The authors discuss the most common mental disorders connected with neuroborreliosis: encephalopathy, cognitive disorders, dementia, depression, anxiety disorders. The paper describes the problem of neuroborreliosis in psychiatry, especially in the endemic regions.
