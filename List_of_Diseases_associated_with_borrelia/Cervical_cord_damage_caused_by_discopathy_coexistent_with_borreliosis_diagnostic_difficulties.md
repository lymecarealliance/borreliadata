## Abstract

Borreliosis is a systemic disease proceeding chronically, in stages and with dermatological, rheumatological and cardiological manifestations. In international terminology the name Lyme borreliosis is most commonly used. Recently the number of the incidents of this disease has increased in Poland as well, particularly among those employed in forests located in endemic regions, which has been confirmed in publications. In this article we present an unusual case of the coexistence of Borrelia burgdorferi infection with cervical medulla injury resulting from discopathy observed in a 65-year-old patient, who additionally suffered from arterial hypertension and diabetes.
