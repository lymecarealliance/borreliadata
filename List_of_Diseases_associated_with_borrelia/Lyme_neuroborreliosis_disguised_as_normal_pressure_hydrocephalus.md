## Abstract

A 74-year-old woman presented with gait impairment, urinary incontinence, and dementia. She showed lymphocytic CSF pleocytosis and pronounced intrathecal Borrelia burgdorferi antibody production, indicating active Lyme neuroborreliosis. The syndrome of normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) fully remitted after ceftriaxone treatment. Lyme neuroborreliosis may cause NPH by interfering with subarachnoid CSF flow.
