## Abstract

Introduction:Lyme disease is a multisystemic disease with protean ocular manifestations. We describe the occurrence of inflammatory choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) in two patients suffering from presumed Lyme disease.

Methods:Descriptive review of the clinical records of two patients.

Results:Patient 1: 16-year-old healthy male presenting with a visual acuity of counting fingers [oculus dexter (OD)] and 6/6 [oculus sinister (OS)] 3 months after a tick bite. He had papillitis and an exudative subretinal macular lesion OD. Treatment was started with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone; a week later, IV methylprednisolone was administered with a tapering dose of oral steroids thereafter. Three months later, VA had improved to 3/60 OD. Patient 2: 38-year-old healthy female presenting with reduced left-eye vision (6/24) 6 weeks after a tick bite. She also suffered from erythema migrans and arthralgias. She had left-eye papillitis, macular haemorrhages and vascular sheathing. Treatment was started with IV ceftriaxone. One month later, there was profound loss of vision with development of CNVM. Treatment was declined by the patient and eventually retinal fibrosis developed.

Conclusion:Inflammatory CNVM has not been described previously in the setting of ocular Lyme borreliosis. We herein describe the occurrence of inflammatory CNVM in two patients whose diagnosis with Lyme disease was clinically based--both were sero-negative. Visual outcome in the two patients was profoundly impaired because of the ensuing macular scar.
