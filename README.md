## 📘 About This Repository

This is an open-access archive of peer-reviewed scientific and clinical resources related to **Borrelia infections**, including but not limited to **Lyme borreliosis**.

All content has been reformatted into **human-readable Markdown (.md) files**, making it ideal for:

## 💡 Why Markdown?

By converting original sources (PDFs, HTML articles, etc.) into clean Markdown files:

- Content becomes **searchable** and **version-controlled**
- It’s easier to parse and integrate with **LLMs, RAG systems, and NLP tools**
- Files remain **readable without special software**
- They can be used directly in documentation platforms, wikis, or internal knowledge bases
