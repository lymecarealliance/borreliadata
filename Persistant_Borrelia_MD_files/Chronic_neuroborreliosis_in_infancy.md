## Content

Lyme disease is a polymorphic and multisystemic disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Neurological manifestations are found in 10%-50% of cases. We present 2 cases followed for 5 and 6 years of chronic relapsing-remitting neuroborreliosis. Diagnosis of neuroborreliosis in these cases was based on serum and cerebrospinal fluid findings. We discuss clinical, neurophysiological, laboratory and instrumental aspects regarding the difficulties of reaching a correct diagnosis. Further studies, especially in the field of immunology, should help identify the mechanisms responsible for the disease becoming chronic. With this knowledge, it may be possible to design immunological therapies for relapses, and to prevent the evolution of the disease.
