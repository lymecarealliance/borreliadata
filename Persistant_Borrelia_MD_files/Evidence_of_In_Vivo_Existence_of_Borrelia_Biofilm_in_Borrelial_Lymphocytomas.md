### Abstract

Lyme borreliosis, caused by the spirocheteBorrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, has grown into a major public health problem. We recently identified a novel morphological form ofB. burgdorferi, called biofilm, a structure that is well known to be highly resistant to antibiotics. However, there is no evidence of the existence ofBorreliabiofilmin vivo; therefore, the main goal of this study was to determine the presence ofBorreliabiofilm in infected human skin tissues. Archived skin biopsy tissues from borrelial lymphocytomas (BL) were reexamined for the presence ofB. burgdorferi sensu latousingBorrelia-specific immunohistochemical staining (IHC), fluorescentin situhybridization, combined fluorescentin situhybridization (FISH)–IHC, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fluorescent and atomic force microscopy methods. Our morphological and histological analyses showed that significant amounts ofBorrelia-positive spirochetes and aggregates exist in the BL tissues. Analyzing structures positive forBorreliashowed that aggregates, but not spirochetes, expressed biofilm markers such as protective layers of different mucopolysaccharides, especially alginate. Atomic force microscopy revealed additional hallmark biofilm features of theBorrelia/alginate-positive aggregates such as inside channels and surface protrusions. In summary, this is the first study that demonstrates the presence ofBorreliabiofilm in human infected skin tissues.

### Introduction

Lyme disease, transmitted by the bite of infected ticks of theIxodesgenus, is an infectious disease caused by spirochetes belonging to the genusBorrelia[1]. Lyme disease is estimated to affect 300,000 people a year in the United States and 65,000 people per year in Europe [2].

Lyme disease patients are treated with various antibiotics though the rates of relapse and recurrence of the disease are frequent after discontinuing the antibiotic treatment [3–7]. It was proposed earlier that the observed antibiotic resistance and reoccurrence of Lyme disease might be due to the formation of defensive morphological forms ofBorrelia burgdorferi[8–10].

In addition to its familiar spirochete form,B. burgdorferican transform from motile spirochetes into round body forms in the presence of various unfavorable environmental conditions including the presence of antimicrobial agents [11–17]. The presence of those alternative forms was confirmed with numerousin vitroandin vivostudies; it was also proven that they respond to different antibiotic treatments than the spirochetal forms [18–22]. However, despite the fact that we might have good understanding about the effective treatment for those known alternative forms,in vivostudies still reported an uncultivable but infective form ofB. burgdorferi, which could evade even the most aggressive antimicrobial treatments [23–26].

Searching for potential answers for the observed high antibiotic resistancein vivo, we identified that this bacterium has an additional morphological form, called biofilm, a form which is very well known for allowing the bacteria to survive in adverse environmental conditions [27–31]. We provided evidence for thein vitroexistence of borrelial biofilm using several known hallmark biofilm features including structural rearrangements in the aggregates producing a complex structure with channel and protrusions, a common feature in biofilm formingPseudomonas aeruginosa,Azotobacter vinelandii, andLeptospira biflexa[32–37]. We also provided evidence thatB. burgdorferi sensu strictoandsensu latoaggregates have specific surface biofilm markers such as alginate [30,38], a mucopolysaccharide which is well characterized in biofilms of other pathogenic bacteria [39].

In addition, we and others have demonstrated thatB. burgdorferiaggregate formation enhances the antibiotic resistance of the organism to various antibiotics, which previously showed some success against the spirochete and round body forms ofB. burgdorferi[20–22,40]. Taken together, thesein vitroobservations of biofilm formation suggest thatB. burgdorfericould play significant role in their survival in diverse environmental conditions, by providing refuge to individual cells. However, the question remains if these structures can be foundin vivoand whether these biofilm structures hold significant relevance for the survival strategies forBorreliaspp. in infected tissues.

In order to answer this question, we reexamined the findings from our earlier studies where we have seen similarBorreliaaggregates in infected skin tissues. We previously investigated different infected biopsy sections from known cutaneous complication of Lyme disease such as erythema chronicum migrans, borrelial lymphocytoma, andBorreliaacrodermatitis chronica atrophicans for the presence ofBorrelia-positive structures [41]. We observed individual spirochetes in the sections as well as putative aggregates especially in the borrelial lymphocytoma (BL) tissues. These structures are strikingly similar to the ones we have previously seen and characterized in ourin vitroculture systems that were proven to be biofilm [30].

Borrelial lymphocytoma, which develops weeks to months after the tick bite, is a rare but typical manifestation of Lyme disease found mainly in Europe [41,42]. Because the low sensitivity of the available serology and molecular biology techniques, clinical diagnosis for BL still relies on clinical presentation and histological examination of the infected tissues [41,42]. For example, histologic examination of cutaneous borrelial infections, including BL, usually reveals an infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells in cutaneous lesions with “acral” predilection which are very characteristic of BL [41,42].

Therefore, in this study, we used BL skin biopsies to evaluate whether the surface ofBorrelia-positive aggregates could contain different mucopolysaccharides, especially alginate, to provide evidence for the existence ofBorreliabiofilmin vivo.First, we usedBorrelia-specific immunohistochemical (IHC), fluorescentin situhybridization (FISH), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques to findBorreliaspirochetes and aggregates in the archived tissue biopsies from BL cases. We then further analyzed the surface ofBorrelia-positive aggregates for potential mucopolysaccharides using different histological, IHC, combined IHC–FISH, and atomic force microscopy methods to further analyze thoseBorrelia/alginate-positive structures.

### Materials and methods

### Human tissue samples, processing biopsy specimens

From the files of our dermatohistopathologic laboratory, archived paraffin materials were retrieved from January 1975 to December 2005 from six cases of clinically confirmed borrelial lymphocytoma by certified dermatopathologists. All six cases had positive serology forBorreliaIgG, and characteristic features of borrelial lymphocytoma with “acral” predilection were found. All six patients were female (average age = 33 years) from endemic areas of Borreliosis in Austria with a rate of positive serology in the population between 30 and 60%. PCR confirmation for all six cases were performed independently in two different laboratories located in Austria and the US. The archival hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections were reexamined, and the previous diagnosis also confirmed by two of us (B.Z. and A.M.D.). Institutional Review Board (IRB) exemption for this study was obtained from University of New Haven.

The paraffin blocks were sectioned by McClain Laboratories LLC (Smithtown NY) at 4 μm on TRUBOND200 adhesive slides. The sections then were deparaffinized by washing the sections three times in 100% xylene for 5 min each followed by rehydration in a series of graded alcohols (100%, 90%, and 70%) and washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 for 5 min. For the immunohistochemical experiments, the tissues were incubated in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer for 45 min at 95 °C for antibody retrieval for the immunohistochemical experiments. For silver penetration method, the modified Dieterle method was used by the McClain Histopathology Laboratories LLC (Smithtown NY) following a previously published procedure by Duray P. et al. [43].

### Bacterial cultures

Low passage isolates (<p3) of B. burgdorferi B31 (ATCC no. 35210), Borrelia garinii (ATCC no. 51991), Borrelia afzelii (ATCC no. 51992), and Treponema denticola (ATCC no. 33520) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Borrelia hermsii was received from Dr. Tom G. Schwan’s laboratory at Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIH. Cells were maintained in Barbour–Stoner–Kelly H (BSK-H, Sigma) media supplemented with 6% or 12% (for T. denticola and B. hermsii) rabbit serum (Pel-Freeze) without antibiotics in sterile 15 ml glass tubes and incubated at 33 °C with 5% CO2.Escherichia colibiofilm forming strain was obtained from ATCC (ATCC no. 25922) and cultured overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm in sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes containing Luria broth media (Difco).

### Slide preparation forin vitroexperiments

Cell concentrations were determined using the Petroff-Hausser counting chamber method. A total of 1 × 106cells per milliliter were centrifuged at 4000×gfor 10 min at room temperature (RT) to remove the media. The supernatant was discarded, pellet was washed two times with 1 ml of 1× PBS (pH 7.4) and then resuspended in 100 μl of 1× PBS (pH 7.4), and the samples were smeared onto glass microscope slides (Superfrost+, Thermo Scientific). The smear was allowed to completely dry in a laminar airflow chamber, followed by fixation with ice-cold acetone for 15 min. Slides were then washed twice with 1× PBS (pH 7.4) at RT and used for the experiments.

### Immunohistochemistry methods (IHC)

Two independent immunohistochemistry methods were performed as described before [30,41]. Initially, the archived BL biopsy samples were immunostained withBorrelia-specific antibody to confirm the presence ofBorreliaspp. in Innsbruck Medical University, utilizing the Ventana-KIT (Ventana Medical Systems, Munich, Germany). In this method, a biotinylated secondary antibody and a third layer of streptavidin–biotin horseradish peroxidase complex were utilized. As a final reaction product, 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) was used with bright red which proved to be superior to the brown diaminobenzidine. Negative control experiments were performed by omitting the primary antibody in an otherwise identical immunohistochemical procedure.

To further confirm the presence ofBorreliaspp. in these tissues, the immunostaining was repeated at the University of New Haven using a previously published immunofluorescence protocol [30]. TheBorrelia–alginate double staining IHC was performed in two different ways. On the same slides using the primary antibodies sequentially or consecutive slides using the two primary antibodies in parallel to provide information whether the two primary antibodies would have cross-reaction with the corresponding secondary antibodies. On the same slide method, the deparaffinized BL sections were first blocked with 10% normal goat serum (Thermo Scientific) in 1× PBS pH (7.4) for 30 min at RT to block nonspecific binding of the secondary antibody. The slides were then washed two times with PBS/0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 5 min each and further incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeledBorrelia-specific polyclonal antibody (#73005 Thermo Scientific, diluted 1:50 in 1× PBS/0.5% BSA). The slides were washed with 1× PBS five times for 5 min each at RT and counterstained with Sudan black (Sigma) and/or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 min. The slides were washed again with 1× PBS for 5 min, dried and mounted with PermaFluor aqueous mounting medium (Thermo Scientific). Images were acquired by fluorescent microscopy (Leica DM2500). On immunostaining method on sequential slides, the two primary antibodies were used in parallel experiment. For the IHC, two additional negative controls were used: 1) omitting primary antibody (use only 1× PBS + 0.5% BSA) and 2) normal human foreskin samples purchased commercially.

### Spicer & Meyer mucopolysaccharide staining

The staining was performed as described previously with minor modifications [30]. Briefly,Borreliaaggregates on the deparaffinized and hydrated BL biopsy sections were stained with aldehyde fuchsine solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.5% fuchsine dye, 6% acetaldehyde in 70% ethanol with 1% concentrated hydrochloric acid) for 20 min. After immersing the slides in 70% ethanol for 1 min and having it rinsed with double-distilled water for another minute, the aggregates were sequentially stained with 1% Alcian blue 8GX (Sigma-Aldrich, dissolved in 3% acetic acid, pH 2.5) for 30 min. The slides were rinsed with double distilled water for 3 min and dehydrated using chilled graded ethanol washes (50%, 70%, and 95%, 3 min each). The slides were then immersed in chilled xylene for 2 min and mounted with Permount media (Fisher Scientific). Images were analyzed using different microscopy methods (see Results section).

### Genomic DNA extraction

Genomic DNA was extracted fromB. afzeliiBO23 laboratory strain (ATCC no. 51992) using Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were stored at –20 °C until analysis. Genomic DNA from paraffin-embedded tissues fixed on glass slides was extracted using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA Formalin-fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) Tissue Kit (Qiagen). First, the slides were deparaffinized, and then any tissues present on the slides were scraped off using sterile blades and collected in sterile microcentrifuge tubes. One hundred eighty microliters of ATL buffer and 20 μl of proteinase K were added to the tubes, and the samples were incubated overnight at 42 °C and then at 90 °C for 1 h to deactivate the enzyme. Two hundred microliters of AL buffer and an additional 200 μl of 96% ethanol were added to the samples and vortexed thoroughly. The samples were then transferred to DNeasy mini columns and centrifuged for 1 min at 6000×g. The flow-through was discarded, and the columns were placed into new collection tubes. To wash away any unwanted materials that might be present along with the DNA, 500 μl of AW1 and AW2 buffers was added to the columns consecutively and centrifuged at 6000×gfor 1 min. The spin columns were placed then in fresh collection tubes and centrifuged at 20,000×gfor 3 min to completely dry the column. The columns were then placed in new microcentrifuge tubes, and the samples were eluted twice with 50 μl of ATE buffer. The samples were quantified using BioTek Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek) and stored at –20 °C until analysis.

### PCR/DNA sequencing

PCR reactions were performed using primers designed to amplifyB. burgdorferi sensu lato16S ribosomal RNA small subunit. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified in a single reaction using primers F: 5′-CCTGGCTTAGAACTAACG-3′ and R: 5′-CCTACAAAGCTTATTCCTCAT-3′ in a 50-μl reaction containing HotStarTaq buffer (Qiagen) 1.5 mM MgCl2, 25 pmoles of each primer, and 2.5 units of HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen). The PCR reaction consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C/30 s, 50 °C/30 s, 72 °C/1 min, and then a final extension at 72 °C/5 min. The PCR products were analyzed by standard agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were eluted twice in 30 μl, and the eluates from each sample were pooled and sequenced in both directions twice (4× coverage) using the same primers that generated the products. All DNA sequencings were performed by Eurofins/MGW/Operon (Huntsville, AL).

### Fluorescentin situhybridization (FISH)

A 32-base-long oligonucleotide probe was designed forB. burgdorferi sensu latospecies-specific 16S ribosomal DNA (5′-GGATATAGTTAGAGATAATTATTCCCCGTTTG-3′). The probe was designed to hybridize withB. burgdorferi,B. garinii, andB. afzelii, but not withT. denticolaandE. colistrains (see validation study below). As a negative control, a 32-base-long random oligonucleotide probe (5′-GCATAGACATGAGATATACTGTACTAG-3′) was also designed. Both probes were synthesized and labeled with 6-fluorescein amidite (FAM) at the 5′ end by Eurofins MWG Operon oligonucleotide services.In situhybridization probes were prepared by mixing 100 ng of labeled oligonucleotide with 2.5 μg salmon sperm DNA (Life Technologies) plus with 0.1 volume 3M sodium acetate (Fisher Scientific) and 2 volumes of ice cold ethanol, and the mixture was allowed to precipitate at –80 °C for 1 h. Probes were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min and resuspended in 10 μl hybridization buffer (50%v/vformamide [Sigma], 10%w/vdextran sulfate [Sigma], 1%v/vTriton X-100 [Sigma], and 2× saline sodium citrate [SSC] pH 7.0). Probes were then warmed to RT for 10 min, denatured at 95 °C for 10 min, and immediately cooled on ice for 10 min. Slides containing fixed cells were denatured in denaturing solution (70%v/vformamide, 2× SSC, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA] pH 7.0) at 70 °C for 5 min and washed twice with cold 2× SSC followed by dehydration through a series of cold alcohol washes (70%, 90%, 100%). The sections were hybridized with the probe in the dark at 48 °C for 24 h. After hybridization, slides were washed three times with 2× SSC for 3 min each at RT followed by two 20 min washes in 0.1× SSC at 42 °C and a final wash in 0.1× SSC at RT. Finally, slides were blocked with freshly made blocking solution (3%w/vBSA [Fisher] in 4× SSC, 0.1%v/vTriton X-100) for 3 min and washed with a wash solution (4× SSC, 0.1 %v/vTriton X-100) for 3 min at room temperature.

For the paraffin-embedded tissue sections, the slides were first deparaffinized by heating on a slide warmer for 40 min at 45 °C and immersed in 100% xylene for 5 min three times. The slides were rehydrated in series of graded alcohols (100%, 90%, and 70%) and washed in PBS for 5 min and in distilled water for 15 min to rehydrate the tissues. The slides were treated with 4% sodium borohydride (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min on ice. The tissues were digested with prewarmed proteinase K solution (20 μg/ml in 50 mM Tris) for 10 min at 37 °C and refixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The slides were denatured using preheated denaturing buffer (70%v/vformamide, 2× SSC, and 0.1 mM EDTA [Fisher] pH 7) at 70 °C followed by prehybridization for 4 h in hybridization buffer (50%v/vformamide [Sigma], 10%w/vdextran sulfate [Sigma], 1%v/vTriton X-100 [Sigma], 2× SSC, [Sigma] pH 7.0, and 2 ng of salmon sperm DNA) in an incubator at 48 °C. The sections were hybridized with the probe at 48 °C for 18 h in dark. After hybridization, slides were washed three times with 2× SSC for 3 min each at room temperature followed by five 20 min washes in 0.1× SSC at 42 °C and a final wash in 2× SSC at room temperature. Finally, slides were blocked with freshly made blocking solution (3%w/vBSA [Fisher] in 4× SSC, 0.1%v/vTriton X-100) for 30 min and washed with wash solution (4× SSC, 0.1 %v/vTriton X-100) for 3 min at room temperature. All steps were repeated with several controls such as: 1) 100 ng negative control random oligonucleotide, 2) 200 ng of unlabeled competing oligonucleotide present during the hybridization, and 3) following a DNase treatment of the sections before the hybridization step to digest all genomic DNA (100 μg/ml for 60 min at 37 °C). All slides were then analyzed by fluorescent microscopy using a Leica DM2500 biomedical microscope.

### Combined FISH and IHC analyses

For the paraffin-embedded tissue sections, slides were first deparaffinized, rehydrated, and pretreated, andin situhybridization protocol was followed as described above in the FISH section. After the last 0.2× SSC wash, the sections were blocked with a 1:100 dilution of goat serum (Thermo Scientific) in 1× PBS pH 7.4 (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature in a humidified chamber. The sections were then washed twice in 1× PBS (Sigma) for 5 min. Slides were then treated with a 1:500 dilution of primary anti-alginate antibody (provided by Dr. Gerald Pier, Harvard Medical School) in 1× PBS and placed in a humidified chamber overnight at room temperature and then washed twice in 1× PBS for 5 min and in distilled water for 5 min. Slides were then treated with a 1:200 dilution of a secondary anti-rabbit antibody with a fluorescent blue tag (405 nm, Thermo Scientific) for 1 h in a humidified chamber at room temperature. The sections were then washed twice in 1× PBS for 5 min and in distilled water for 5 min. Sections were then washed in 0.2× SSC for 5 min in the dark at room temperature. Sections were then counterstained with Sudan Black (Sigma) for 20 min. Sections were mounted with PermaFluor (Thermo Scientific), and images were captured using a Leica DM2500 fluorescent microscope. As a negative control, all steps were repeated with 200 ng of competing unlabeled oligonucleotide present during the hybridization.

### Atomic force microscopy

TheBorrelia/alginate-positive structures were visualized at nanometer-scale resolution through atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses. First, the biopsy section was hydrated overnight at RT with 1× PBS (pH 7.4) buffer and rinsed with double distilled water two times before the scan. AFM scans on BL tissues were performed in contact mode using the Nanosurf Easyscan 2 AFM (Nanosurf) with SHOCONG probe (AppNANO™). Images were taken by Hamamatsu ORCA Digital Camera. Images were processed, and measurements were obtained using Gwyddion software.

### Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using Student’st-test (Microsoft Excel, Redmond, WA) on the number of observed spirochetes and aggregates found in the 200 sections of the six BL specimens. Statistical significance was determined based onpvalue <0.05.

### Results

### Presence ofBorreliaspirochetes and aggregates in BL tissues sections

The overall goal of this study was to reexamine cutaneous cases of BL tissues to examine the potential presence ofBorreliabiofilmsin vivo.First, six cases of borrelial lymphocytoma archived tissues were retrieved from the files of our Dermatohistopathologic Laboratory in the Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Medical University Innsbruck. Archival H&E-stained sections were reexamined, and previous diagnoses were confirmed by two of us (B.Z. and A.M.D.). The presence ofBorreliawas confirmed independently by two previously published immunohistochemical methods [41] in Medical University Innsbruck (Innsbruck, Austria) and in University of New Haven (West Haven, CT) combined with silver staining method performed in McClain Laboratory (Long Island, NY).Figure 1shows the representative images of the immunohistochemistry results of the six BL cases performed in Medical University Innsbruck. In all BL cases, the presence ofBorreliaspirochetes and aggregates was clearly visible (red staining).Figure 1EandFshow the presence ofBorrelia-positive aggregates which were the subject for our further studies.

To further confirm the presence ofBorreliain the BL tissues, modified Dieterle method silver staining techniques were performed independently in McClain histopathology laboratories (Smithtown, NY).Figure 2Ashows representative images of silver staining results on the BL tissues sections demonstrating silver stain positive spirochetal structures (Fig. 2, panels Ai and iv) as well as different sizes of silver-stained positive aggregates (Fig. 2, panels Aii and iii).

White arrows in panel A show the silver-stained spirochetes (i and iv) and aggregates (ii and iii), and panel B shows one of the silver-stained aggregates (panel Aiii) stained positive forBorreliaantigen. As a negative control for the immunohistochemical method, panel Bvii shows a no antibody control on consecutive section, and panel Bviii is the DIC image of the panel Bvii section to prove that there is still aggregate on the tissue section. 400× magnification, bar: 200 μm

Aggregates which were positive for silver staining were then subjected to additional studies by immunostaining at the University of New Haven (West Haven CT, USA) of the consecutive sections with a differentBorrelia-specific antibody to confirm that they are borrelial aggregates.Figure 2Bshows that a silver-stained structure (can be found in both panel Aiii and panel Bv), but not the “no antibody” control (Fig. 2, panel Bvii), indeed stained positively withBorreliaantibody (Fig. 2, panel Bvi, green fluorescent staining) on the consecutive slide.Figure 2, panel Bviii, is a differential interference contract microscopy (DIC) image ofFig. 2, panel Bvii, demonstrating that there is stillBorreliaaggregate on the slide despite the absence of staining.

### Fluorescencein situhybridization (FISH) and PCR further proveBorreliaDNA presence in BL tissues

To further confirm that the silver-stained aggregates observed in the BL tissues are indeed borrelial aggregates, we performed FISH experiments using aB. burgdorferi sensu lato-specific 16S rDNA probe. The specificity of ourin situhybridization method was first confirmed using commercially available laboratory strains forB. burgdorferi,B. garinii,B. afzelii,B. hermsii,T. denticola, andE. coli(see Materials and methods section).Figure 3shows that allBorreliaspecies stained positive while non-Borreliaspecies such asT. denticolaandE. coliwere found negative forBorrelia-specific DNA probe.

A representative image shows a validation study for our 16S rDNA fluorescentin situhybridization (FISH) protocol using different bacterial cells. The different bacterial cells placed on microscope slides and fixed and FISH protocols were carried out as described in Materials and methods section. The same FISH protocols were carried out on every experiment forBorrelia afzelii(panels A and B),Borrelia garinii(panels C and D),Treponema denticola(panels E and F),Borrelia burgdorferi(panels G and H),Borrelia hermsii(panels I and J), andEscherichia coli(panels K and L).

After validation of the experimental conditions with laboratory strains, we have used thisBorrelia-specific FISH protocol on BL tissues sections.Figure 4shows a representative image of the FISH experiments that demonstrates that an aggregate found in BL tissues was successfully hybridized withBorrelia-specific 16S rDNA probe without significant background noise (A). As comprehensive negative controls, a competing oligonucleotide (B), DNase-treated samples (C), and a random probe (D) experimental conditions were used on consecutive tissue sections to show the specificity of the 16S rDNA FISH probe. None of the negative control experimental conditions resulted in significant fluorescent signal, providing evidence that the FISH experimental procedure is specific forBorreliaDNA.

As comprehensive negative controls, a competing oligonucleotide (B), DNase-treated samples (C), and a random DNA probe (D) were used on consecutive tissue sections to further show the specificity of the 16S rDNA probe (further details of the experimental conditions are in Materials and methods section). The tissue morphology was demonstrated with DAPI nuclear (E) and differential interphase contrast microscopy (DIC, panel F). 400× magnification, bar: 200 μm

Further validation of the presence ofBorreliaspp. in the BL tissue biopsies was provided by extracting the genomic DNA and amplifyingB. burgdorferi sensu lato-specific16S rDNA. Genomic DNA extracted from aB. afzeliilaboratory strain (BO23) was used as a positive control, and no template control was used as negative controls.Figure 5demonstrates the result of the PCR experiments demonstrating the expected PCR bands in both the DNA extracted from the BL skin sections (S1–S6) as well as in the laboratory strain positive control(Fig. 5). No PCR products were seen in the no template samples (–C), thus eliminating the possibility of contamination and, therefore, a nonspecific amplification in the PCR reaction. All PCR products were sequenced and analyzed by the BLAST program (NCBI) and identified to have 99–100% identity to theB. afzelii16S rDNA gene compared to theB. afzelii K78reference strain obtained from an Austrian cutaneous lesion, thus confirming the presence ofB. afzeliiDNA in our European BL biopsies.

The bands seen in lanes of +C and S1–S6 (~450 bp) represent DNA amplified usingBorrelia-specific primers which have a target size of 445 bp, indicating the presence ofBorrelia burgdorferi sensu latoDNA in the samples. No bands were seen in the negative control (–C)

### Presence of biofilm markers associated with the aggregates in BL tissues

Having conclusively demonstrated the presence ofBorreliaspirochetes and aggregates in BL tissues, we next asked whether theBorrelia-positive aggregates found in the BL tissue are biofilms. A hallmark characteristic of biofilms is the presence of extracellular polysaccharides which play major roles in protection, immune evasion, and antibiotic resistance. We had previously shown that the biofilms formed by variousBorreliaspecies are rich in mucopolysaccharides and share similarities with biofilms formed by other bacteria [32–39]. We characterized the presence of mucopolysaccharides using an adaptation of the Spicer & Meyer aldehyde fuchsine–alcian blue sequential staining method (see Materials and methods section), which can differentiate between sulfated and non-sulfated/carboxylated mucins. Fuchsia/purple coloration indicates sulfated mucins while blue coloration indicates non-sulfated/carboxylated mucins. Results of this staining method show thatBorrelia-positive aggregates in BL biopsies have similar staining pattern to thein vitro Borreliaaggregates found previously [30] staining for both sulfated (fuchsia/purple) and non-sulfated (blue) mucins.Figure 6shows the Spicer & Meyer staining pattern of two representative aggregates (white arrows) found in the BL biopsies by dark field(Fig. 6AandC)and DIC microscopy methods (Fig. 6BandD). The images depicting all three colors: fuchsia, purple, and blue indicate various mucopolysaccharides with different chemical composition on the surface ofBorreliaaggregates in the BL tissues.

Fuchsia/purple colorations are indicative of sulfomucins and blue coloration indicates non-sulfated, carboxylated mucins. 400× magnification, bar: 200 μm

Taken together, these results demonstrate that the aggregates found in BL tissues areBorrelia-positive by two independently performed IHC and FISH techniques and they do contain certain biofilm markers such as mucopolysaccharides on their surfaces. The blue coloration on the surface of the aggregates indicated non-sulfated mucins which strongly suggested alginate presence similarly to what we found on the surface ofin vitro Borreliabiofilms.

### Borreliaaggregates, but not spirochetes, strongly express alginates

In the following experiments, the goal was to confirm thatBorreliaaggregates indeed have alginate on their surfaces, by different immunostaining methods usingBorrelia- and alginate-specific antibodies. Alginate antibody used in this study was validated in our previousin vitrostudies showing that it does not stain individualBorreliaspirochetes as well as certainE. colibiofilms [30,39]. As additional independent control, we have also used 20 commercially purchased normal human foreskin sections.Figure 7shows representative images of BL sections positively costained with bothBorrelia- and alginate-specific antibodies (Fig. 7A–BandD–E). We also repeated the double staining experiments on consecutive slides usingBorreliaand alginate antibodies to demonstrate independentBorreliaand alginate stainings on the same biofilm (Fig. 7GandH).

Representative images of IHC analyses of spirochetes and aggregates found in BL tissues costained withBorrelia(green) and alginate (red) antibodies on the same tissue sections (panels A and B as well as D and E) or consecutive tissue section (panels G and H). As negative control, the same IHC experiments were repeated on normal foreskin tissue sections (panels J and K). Differential interference contrast (DIC) images were provided to show the morphology of the tissues (panels C, F, I, and L). 400× magnification, bar: 200 μm

To further prove that the primaryBorrelia- and alginate-specific antibodies do not have unspecific staining on human skin tissue, we have repeated the above experiments on human foreskin sections (Fig. 7JandK). Also, all individual spirochetes (Fig. 7AandD;white arrowheads) were all alginate negative (Fig. 7BandE), a result, which further demonstrates that alginate is specific toBorreliaaggregates and the two antibodies used in these experiments do not cross-react.

In the next experiments, we repeated the IHC experiments withBorrelia- and alginate-specific antibodies using 1200 sections (200 sections/specimen). While the majority of the sections contained at least oneBorreliaimmunopositive spirochete (none of them stained for alginate), only ~5% of all the sections containedBorrelia-positive aggregates with all different sizes.Figure 8represents a summary graph of the number of the spirochetes (ranging from 350 to 480 spirochetes/200 sections/specimen) and the number of aggregates (ranging from 4 to 12 aggregates/200 sections/specimen) observed in the six BL tissues (BL1-BL6) as well as in the commercially purchased normal human foreskin tissue specimens (control). There were no detectableBorrelia-positive spirochetes or aggregates found in any of the control specimens. Statistical analyses of the number of spirochetes or aggregates detected in the six BL tissues showed no significant differences among the specimens (pvalues >0.05).

There were no detectable spirochetes or aggregates found in any of the control specimens

IHC findings demonstrated that everyBorreliaaggregate, but not any of the observed spirochete, was also positive for alginate. Very importantly, nonspecific alginate staining was not observed anywhere else in the BL skin tissues.Figure 9shows the heterogeneity in sizes ofBorreliaaggregates in BL biopsies which were positive for bothBorreliaand alginate antigens.

In the merged picture, yellow/light orange indicates the regions where bothBorreliaand alginate are present. 1000× magnification, bar: 200 μm

### Combined FISH and IHC experiments further provide evidence thatBorreliaaggregates indeed express alginate on their surfaces

Alternatively, the expression of alginate on the surface ofBorrelia-positive aggregates in BL skin tissues was also detected using a combined FISH and IHC experiments with 16S rDNA probe forBorreliadetection and alginate antibody for alginate antigen detection.Figure 11shows a representative image which shows that aBorrelia-specific FISH positive structure (A) stains for alginate (B) as well as detected by IHC method. As a negative control, a competing oligonucleotide FISH was included to demonstrate the specificity of theBorreliaFISH DNA probe (C).

To show that the structure indeed isBorreliaDNA positive, competing oligonucleotide was used as a negative control (panel C).

### Ultra structural analysis of theBorrelia-and alginate-positive aggregates in BL biopsies by atomic force microscopy (AFM)

Finally, to understand the ultrastructural organization ofBorreliaand alginate dual positive aggregates, we performed atomic force microscopy.Figure 12shows representative micrographs of a dual stainedBorreliaaggregate costained with bothBorrelia- and alginate-specific antibodies, which is deeply embedded in the surrounding tissues, observed using DIC microscopy(Fig. 12B). AFM topographical scans also confirmed that the aggregates are indeed embedded in the tissues (indicated by the red arrows) and have the characteristic channels and protrusions that we observed in thein vitro Borreliabiofilms (red and green arrowheads respectively)(Fig. 12A).

Panel A shows a representative image from the AFM analyses which was performed using contact mode of the Nanosurf Easyscan 2 AFM with SHOCONG probe (AppNANO™ [30]). Images were processed, and measurements were obtained using Gwyddion software. The individual height and width ranges are indicated on the panels. Panel B shows evidence that the scanned tissue isBorrelia-and alginate-positive by fluorescent IHC analyses (400× magnification). Red arrows represent the same area of the tissue illustrated on panels A and B.

### Discussion

We have previously provided evidence thatB. burgdorferi sensu strictoandsensu lato, the Lyme disease causing spirochete bacteria, are capable of forming biofilmsin vitro[30,38]. The goal of this study was to find and characterize potentialBorreliabiofilmsin vivousing infected skin tissues of BL biopsies from Austrian Lyme disease patients. Our findings demonstrated that the observed aggregates are indeedBorrelia-positive structures that express specific biofilm markers such as sulfated and non-sulfated mucopolysaccharides which are mainly alginate. Our data also demonstrated that the observedBorrelia-positive spirochetes do not express alginate which further support the hypothesis that thoseBorrelia-positive aggregates are indeed biofilm structures. Our AFM studies further characterized the ultrastructure ofBorrelia- and alginate-positive aggregates and found additional biofilm characteristic properties such as channels and protrusions of the tissue-embedded biofilms.

Human biopsies used in this study were lesions from BL from Lyme disease patients, a skin condition known for the presence ofBorreliaspirochetes and reported mainly from Europe [42].

BL biopsies were previously analyzed for the different morphological forms ofBorreliathrough focus-floating microscopy methods [41]. Findings from this study revealed the presence ofBorreliaspirochetes as clusters of granular colonies. These descriptions are consistent with an aggregate of organisms enmeshed in a matrix, similar to theBorreliabiofilm foundin vitro[30,38]. To determine whether theBorreliaaggregates described in BL biopsies are indeed biofilms, BL biopsy tissues from the same archive collection were reexamined for biofilm-specific markers. Our results on human BL biopsy sections first revealed the presence ofBorreliaspirochetes and aggregates byBorrelia-specific IHC methods combined with additional silver staining, FISH techniques. To confirm the specificity of our techniques, we provided several independent negative controls for both the IHC and FISH experiments such as: 1) the samples were analyzed independently in European and in US laboratories respectively; 2)Borreliaand alginate IHC experiments were performed on the same and sequential slides; 3) use of uninfected human foreskin samples and no antibody control in the immunohistochemical experiments; 4) validation of our FISH experiments with borrelial and non-borrelial laboratory strains; 5) differentin situhybridization negative controls (competing oligonucleotide, random DNA probes, and DNase-treated samples); and 6) combined IHC–FISH experiments, which all provided evidence that the results are indeed specific and do not represent background tissue staining.

Our findings also suggested that thoseBorrelia-positive aggregates, but not spirochetes, have several classical features of biofilm structures because they were strongly positive for different mucopolysaccharides as well as for alginate, a negatively charged sugar polymer.Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the causative agent of cystic fibrosis, forms biofilms rich in alginate that confer it protection from the host immune system [33,35,45–47]. Studies further reported that these biofilms are very resistant to antibiotics and result in chronic inflammation and damage to cystic fibrosis lung tissues. In other studies, however, it was confirmed that even after the degradation of the alginate present on the biofilm surface, the gentamycin resistance of the biofilm was not affected [46]. This implies that alginate might not be the only reason for the resistance of biofilms and that there are other components which confer antibiotic resistance. The exact role of alginate presence on the surface onBorreliaaggregates in the infected skin tissues still needs to be determined as well as the other potential protective layers indicated by our Spicer & Meyer findings.

The presence of alginate on theBorrelia-positive structures in LB tissues also provides a good argument against the theory called “amber hypothesis” which hypothesizes that dead spirochetes and borrelial debris can persist in the tissue and cause chronic inflammation in Lyme disease patients [48,49]. The authors of these studies argued against the idea of potential biofilm because the isolatedBorreliaaggregates found in mouse skin tissues failed to growin vitro. Culture negativity of biofilms from different pathogens is one of the cornerstone concepts for the behavior of true biofilms [50,51] as it was shown in biofilms in culture-negative orthopedic and endocardiatic biofilm infections [51,52] and therefore cannot be used to dismiss the idea thatBorreliacan make biofilmin vivo.

Among the order Spirochaetales, biofilms fromT. denticolaandLeptospiraspp. have already been reported in periodontal diseases and dental water systems, respectively [37,53]. Further investigation ofT. denticolabiofilm development revealed that it could be achievedin vitroon fibronectin surfaces in a low-shear-force environment [54]. We also found that certain surfaces are preferable forBorreliabiofilm formationin vitrosuch as collagen and fibronectin surfaces [30,38], which correlates well with the results from this study whereBorreliaaggregates were found in collagen- and fibronectin-rich skin tissues. Our differential interference contrast and atomic force microscopy data also showed that theBorreliabiofilms embedded deeply in the tissue suggesting a potential host tissue rearrangement during biofilm growth. The exact mechanism of host tissue remodeling during the dissemination ofB. burgdorferiis under active investigation and suggests the use of a variety of bacterial factors and host enzymes; therefore, it is very likely that thoseBorreliaaggregates could use the same mechanism to embed the biofilm in the tissues and further protect the structure from the host defense. Findings from this study could also raise the question about the kind of other tissues that could be potential target for theseBorreliabiofilm structures. In one of our ongoing mouse studies, we have analyzed multiple tissue sites inBorrelia-infected Balb/c mice model and found in multiple tissues with similarBorrelia-positive aggregates with alginate presence [55]. We are also in the process studying the molecular mechanism of the antibiotic resistance ofBorreliaaggregates using differentBorreliamutant cell lines and identified important pathways which might be responsible for the observed resistance. For example, Lux S quorum sensing deficientBorreliamutant showed incomplete biofilm development and reduced resistance against certain antibiotics, a result which agrees with the potential function of Lux S pathway during mammalian infection [56,57].

In summary, in this study, we provided several lines of evidence thatBorreliabiofilm could existin vivo. Further confirmation and characterization of the presence of biofilmin vivowould help us better understand the survival strategies of theBorreliaspp. within its host and would provide important clinical data for therapeutic intervention for Lyme disease patients.
