Difficulties in diagnosis of late stages of Lyme disease include low sensitivity of serological testing and late inclusion of Lyme disease in the differential diagnosis. Longer treatment modalities may have to be considered in order to improve clinical outcome of late disease stages. These difficulties clinical cases of Lyme borreliosis. The different clinical cases illustrate several aspects of late borreliosis: false negative serology due to narrow antigen composition of the used ELISA format, the need for prolonged antibiotic treatment in chronic or recurrent forms and typical presentations of late Lyme disease, such as lymphocytic meningo-encephalitis and polyradiculoneuritis.
