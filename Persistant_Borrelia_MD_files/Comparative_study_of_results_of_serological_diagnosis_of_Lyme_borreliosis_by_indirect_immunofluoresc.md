## Content

A total of 176 sera from 73 patients with verified Lyme borreliosis at different stages of the disease are examined. Serological diagnosis was carried out by 2 methods: indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) with corpuscular B. burgdorferi antigen and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with purified flagellar B. burgdorferi antigen (Dako). EIA with Dako antigen is more sensitive for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis at any period of the disease than IIF. Analysis of correlations between the results of IIF and EIA showed correlation in the levels of IgG but not IgM antibodies. The findings confirmed a previous hypothesis that inadequate antibacterial therapy before investigation decreases the level of antibodies to Borrelia. In patients with a history of Lyme borreliosis, antibodies to B. burgdorferi are detected less frequently by both IIF and EIA. Patients with persistent levels of antibodies to B. burgdorferi, even without clinical signs of infection, are in need of regular check-ups, because the prognostic significance of antibodies to B. burgdorferi is unknown and relapses may occur after months and years.
